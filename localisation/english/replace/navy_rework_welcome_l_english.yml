 navy_rework_welcome_splash_tab_1_content: "The navy rework has adopted a semi-historical designer and balanced all the stats of modules.\n\n-When designing a §Ydestroyer§!, §Ycruiser, §! or §Ybattleship§!, the §Ymain gun§! is the only thing reflecting reality here. Since their firepower or AP are balanced, §Rplease make sure that their numbers are close to reality§!. Modules including §Ysecondaries§! and §Ytorpedo§! are the same as vanilaa.\n-Some restricted modules are unlocked in the mod, you can build battleships with super heavy guns, heavy cruisers with light guns and unprotected cruisers.\n-Ship roles are essential on destroyers and cruisers, they can offer different bonuses and unlock special modules.\n-§RThe AP shell is for balancing ships with different number of guns, it's not meant for player's usage.§!\n-Torpedoes can do great damage to heavy ships, while armor can only defend a little, you have to install §YTorpedo Defense system§! to avoid that.\n-Although the appearance of tech tree is changed, its core is still simialr to vanilla, you don't need another hour to find out how it works."
 navy_rework_welcome_splash_tab_2_content: "The form of naval combat is changed in this mod, it features the following:\n\n-The minimum time of naval combat is increased to 20 hrs, capital ships fire at 24, other ships 26, while carriers are able to fight from the very beginning. The way you use CV naval bomber is more decisive here.\n-Ship AA guns and CV fighters are buffed with extra damage and targetting. Carrier taskforce without fighters' cover could lose more bombers.\n-Airplane launcher, carrier and sonar are more useful and stronger in anti-submarine warfare, while the base visibility of submarines is increased, making it less dominant against surface fleet with good sub detection."
 navy_rework_welcome_splash_tab_3_content: "Hi Everyone, the navy rework has been through the most difficult part of development, right now it has a historical designer, historical and realistic starting navies and designs, unique icons and a tech tree. As the framework is almost set, the rest, such as extensions, will be easier. I'd like to take this opportunity to share the past and future of this mod.\n\nI bought HOI4 in 2016 and first learned about Kaiserreich when it released ver 0.6, the Nightmare of Garibaldi. With its detailed and interesting WWII scenario, it's been one of my favorite mods since then. The naval rework released in 0.8 only took it further, I couldn't help but imagine what those dreadnoughts would look like in KRTL.\n\nOn a Friday afternoon just before 2021 Chinese New Year, I was sitting in the office and browsing Reddit, and that was when I came across an extraordinary text about Canadian and Japanese Navy written by Tragic-tragedy. I translated it and shared with the Chinese community, then I started writing blogs on the naval lore for KR, which laid a foundation for this mod.\n\nBefore the 0.22 update, the navy system has been cut for various reasons. Although I felt sad about this, it also gave me the motivation and determination to do something I have never imagined. Programming is my job, but I had to learn photoshop and English writing from scratch. Half a year passed, and we finally have the KR and KX version published.\n\nI want to express my sincere thanks to players and friends from the HOI4 community. Thank you for subscribing this mod and I wish you well.\n\nAs I'm getting busier than before on my work and family, I have no idea if it can be continued in the future, so I'm looking to build a small team to keep this mod going."
 navy_rework_welcome_splash_tab_4_content: "Hi guys, I'm looking to build a small team or have partners for this mod and its KX version. The background is that I have to handle my work, part-time master degree and my family, there is less time I can spend on modding. But I don't want to give it up right now, so if you are interested, please let me know. Programming skill is not a must, the team also need artists and advisers."
