 naval_lore_title_1_jap: "§HLegacy of Tsushima, Imperial Japanese Navy: 1910-1925§!"
 naval_lore_desc_1_jap: "Empowered by results of the Meiji Restoration in culture and industry, Japan had already built up a considerable naval power with imported battleships by the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War. Victories over Qing and Russia at the turn of the 20th century marked a new dawn in Japan's regional hegemony and a rapid growth of its navy.\n\nOn the execuse of Anglo-Japanese Alliance, Japan declared war against Germany upon the start of the Weltkrieg and occupied its possessions in the Pacific. Without a nearby battlefront, Japanese resources were diverted to naval construction. Once dwarfed by Europeans, the status of Japanese Navy had been improved since the purchase of Kongo, which was the first Japanese warship to embrace firepower of super-dreadnought level. It didn't take too long before Japan's first effort to build its own dreadnoughts of western standard, and they would be two Fuso-class, and two Ise-class with modified turret layout.\n\nUpon that, the Eight-Eight Fleet initiative was proposed by Naval General Staff to fund several shipbuilding programs in the following years. It started in 1917 with two Nagato-class armed with eight 410mm guns, and two Tosa-class with an extra turret in 1920. Japan's breakthrough in steam turbines allowed them to sail at a top speed of 26kn, faster than any battleships built by other countries. Alongside Tosa, four Amagi-class battlecruisers were ordered to lead the scouting force, but in 1923, the Kanto Earthquake destroyed Amagi's hull, with Takao inheriting her sister's name. Meanwhile, a few squadrons of Kamikaze- and Mutsuki-class destroyers were built to counter the threat from the United States Navy.\n\nBesides battleships, Japan also pioneered in naval aviation. Its first aviation department, the Commission on Naval Aeronautical Research was established in 1912. It arranged conversions of several seaplane carriers from other vessels during the war. The experience would be crucial in the design of Hosho, the first dedicated aircraft carrier in history.\n\nAs the war in Europe drew to an end, Japan refused to surrender Pacific-German possessions despite the peace deal signed between Entente and Central Powers in 1919, but it eventually gave up in the 1921 Tsingtao Accord facing British and American pressure. The peace didn't halt Japan's effort to have the first-class navy in the world and it placed orders of four Kii-class in response to post-war naval programs of other powers. However, they would soon be outdated by British and German designs with 18-inch guns. It was then that \"Battleship M\" with twelve 460mm guns, later know as Aki-class, were laid, but it would be all in vain when the Great Depression reached Japan's shore in 1925. Just a year ago, Japan had sunk 70% of its military expenditure in the naval race, and it was becoming an unaffordable game for Japan's shaky finacial state. Fearing army's anger and public opposition, hulls of Aki-class were scrapped and sold along with half-built Suruga and Omi (3rd and 4th of Kii Class). It was not until the end of 1920s that Kii and Owari were finally finished, four years behind schedule."

 naval_lore_desc_2_jap: "After its funds got cut in 1925, IJN had entered a dark era in the face of imminent German interventionism in Asia. Against two enemies in the Pacific region, Japan adopted a more defensive \"Decisive Battle\" doctrine which tried to annihilate intruding fleets in one major battle.\n\nHowever, the Combined Fleet was aging, and it was obliged to abandon all ambitious building plans. The oldest battleship, Kongo, had been in service for more than 15 years and desperately needed to be replaced after its engine modernization was waived. Settling for the second best, a new type of ship was planned based on B65, a large cruiser designated to be commanding ship of night battles. The Navy Technical Department managed to reuse some old technologies from Kongo, and installed six 356mm guns on it. In 1929, Furutaka and Kako were orderd, followed by slightly modified Aoba and Kinugasa in just a few months.\n\nMeanwhile, limited investment had redirected navy's focus to lighter ships. Since the end of the war, destroyers and cruisers have witnessed a trend of enlargement to overwhelm their rivals, and the Type-1924 destroyers built by Germany only made it more pronounced. To counter it, the Navy Technical Department proposed the Special-Type destroyers, such as Fubuki-, Ayanami- and Akatsuki-class, which would come in batches with slightly different layouts. They became known for high speed and heavy armaments including six 127mm guns in three turrets and the infamous Type-93 oxygen torpedo. Despite the paper firepower, their high-speed design was achieved by lighter hull which would end up with poor stability. It was improved in the construction of Shiratsuyu-class and refits of defective ships.\n\nWith economy slowly recovering in the 1930s, the National Diet spared some budgets for navy, and it limped to restart fleet renovation in the upcoming Ship Replenishment Plans (Maru Keikaku), which would start in 1931, 1934 and 1937. The first plan included four moderately armed Tokachi-class cruisers to balance the budget, and the light carrier Ryujo which put an end to the decade-long neglect of aircraft carrier. The second plan started in 1934 and was centered around four Monobe-class cruisers, an upgraded version of Tokachi. Cheaper than their counterparts, Tokachi and Monobe were favored by navy for their versatility. Given the course changing in naval doctrine throughout the 1930s, Japan laid Soryu in 1934 as its first standard fleet carrier.\n\nAs soon as the Second Maru Keikaku was completed, Japan would once again engage in heavy investment of its navy and eventually become a naval superpower on the Pacific Ocean."

 GER_naval_lore: "History of Imperial German Navy"
 naval_lore_title_1_ger: "§HHeil dir im Siegerkranz, Kaiserliche Marine: 1900-1922§!"
 naval_lore_desc_1_ger: "The Imperial German Navy embarked on a massive fleet expansion program right after the commission of HMS Dreadnought. Rising from a naval race with the United Kingdom, Germany had rapidly grown into the second-strongest naval power in the world. Its first dreadnought, SMS Nassau, was quickly outdated, and the same fate also had the Helgoland-class in the face of battleship evolution. From 1910 to 1914, the Hochseeflotte slowly caught up with the Royal Navy in terms of dreadnoughts, with a force centered around König-class battleships and a squad of well-protected battlecruisers. The war did not shake its determination to match the British. By the beginning of the war, construction of four Bayern-class battleships and three Derfflinger-class battlecruisers had already been scheduled.\n\nDespite the tactical victory in Jutland, 1916, Germany failed to break Royal Navy's blockade, encouraging General Ludendorff to propose reopening the unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917. The Kaiser decided against him at first but finally agreed in late-1918 when the chance of war between Germany and US had already diminished. With adequate investment, SMS Württemberg and two Mackensen-class battlecruisers were commissioned in 1918 (two more in 1919). From there, the Reichstag approved a war fund in early 1919 for four Preußen-class and three Yorck-class.\n\nBy summer 1919, Entente's morale had been crushed under advancing German boots. Surrender of France became the last straw on the western alliance, which France submit to German conditions in the Treaty of Versailles facing internal revolts.\n\nAlthough the war was over, Germany's fleet expansion had triggered insecurity in Britain, leading to continuation of the Grand Fleet. With the army demobilized and Ludendorff descending from power, radical officers in navy exploited their ties with shipbuilding enterprises, and asked for an even bigger expansion on the excuse of protecting Germany from another blockade. Regardless of oppositions in the government, the 1920 Flottengesetze (Fleet Laws) was forced through after a half-year long debate. In October 1920, shortly after the final member of Preußen-class was laid down, German navy was given greenlight to begin constructions of the Yorck-class from 1920 to 1921. Astronomical funds were sunk into these programs and stimulated Germany's industrial chain, avoiding a potential post-war economic meltdown.\n\nHowever, the news went across the Channel and shocked the British Admiralty. Provoked by Germany's ambitious plan, Britain could no longer stand failure of the Two-Power Standard. The Royal Navy hastened the designing of next-gen warships (N3 & G3), and they would be built in two batches from 1922 to 1923. To ensure superiority, they adopted advanced armor scheme and larger caliber than German counterparts, with 18\" on N3 and 16\" on G3. Not surprisingly, these constructions met strong answers from Germany, US and Japan.\n\nTo keep up with Britain, Admiral Tirpitz appealed to the Kaiser for support. As a naval enthusiast, Wilhelm II has been a firm advocator of naval expansion. Under his influence, the Reichstag narrowly agreed to spare more money for an additional group of five battleships to compete with Britain's N3 project."


 naval_lore_title_2_ger: "§HDeutschland über Alles, Kaiserliche Marine: 1922-1936§!"
 naval_lore_desc_2_ger: "By late-1922, the first group of Germany's post-war battleships had been commissioned, followed by Yorck in just a year. In response to HMS Magnificent laid earlier that year, ThyssenKrupp began to build two Schlesien-class battleships after widening its largest dock. These behemoths were armed with nine 480mm guns, making Germany the third country in manufacturing super heavy dreadnoughts after Britain and America.\n\nAs the naval race escalating, it greatly hindered economic recovery of major powers. The first domino fell in 1924, as the shocking news of British Revolution almost instantly ended the race. Seizing this opportunity, Germany took over some British colonies in Africa and Asia that were seeking protection from local anti-colonialism. The sudden establishment of German colonial empire had put heavy pressure on its merchant navy and global logistics. Nonetheless, with flowing fortunes from the most profitable colonies in the world, the 1924 Flottengesetze met a warm welcome within conservative governing coalition, and plenty of funds were raised for the plan which called for construction of new battleships and cruisers. To replace Nassau-class and Helgoland-class battleships built before the war, four Siegfried-class were ordered in 1925 and 1926, and they were in most copies of Preußen but slightly modified.\n\nSince Germany had lost its greatest rival on the Atlantic, budget was invested in the obsolete Asian Fleet against Japan that adhered a hardline anti-German policy. Its effort would be a pair of battlecruisers, Schlieffen and Steinmetz, an improved version of Yorck but modified to fit poor infrastructure in Singapore. The rest of the budget, however, was used in an attempt to please the Kaiser and announce the ultimate victory of Germany in the naval race, the 80,000-ton battleship SMS Kaiser Wilhelm. As a present to the Ruby Jubilee of Kaiser's coronation, it was armed with eight 20\" guns, shadowing every battleship built before. Laid in 1925 and finally finished in 1932, it marked an end to all the madness seen during the Dreadnought Race. Countless malfunctions have been the theme of this monster's service that even the most radical battleship fanatic in the navy considered it as a white elephant.\n\nGerman navy was hindered by massive dreadnought projects in the late-1920s. Besides slowly advancing those unfinished, it also developed several types of budget cruisers for its vast colonial empire. Among them, armored cruisers were the most special. The revival of armored cruiser was an interesting idea invented by German naval architects. With intermediate firepower only inferior to battlecruiser, armored cruiser was designated as economical capital ship for colonies overseas, making Germany's presence stronger in distant waters.\n\nAs a consequence of trying to win the race, Germany almost stagnated in most naval innovations and had zero operational carrier by 1932, which was changed that year by commision of Weser-class, a reluctant move to strengthen the scouting force. Designing failures and resources wasting in the construction of SMS Kaiser Wilhelm, however, drove reformists in the navy to advocate doctrinal revolution. Carrier was on the list but still not getting enough attention. While the officers at home just took the first step to develop fast battleships such as Blücher, East Asian Fleet has become a test field for new tactics with a fleet centered around fast raiding ships and carriers, but its influence on Berlin was still not clear.\n\nIn 1936, despite a formidable size, the Kaiserliche Marine is overly extended and desperately needs a change."
 
 ENG_naval_lore: "History of British Royal/Republican Navy"
 naval_lore_title_1_eng: "§HRule the Waves, Royal Navy: 1900-1925§!"
 naval_lore_desc_1_eng: "Possessing the largest navy in the Victorian Era, the United Kingdom had always been the strongest naval power since the mid-19th century, and led the naval development through its unparalleled technologies.\n\nIn the 1900s, Europe was on the brink of war at Germany's ambition to pursue a place in the sun. The Royal Navy got unprecedented investment against expanding German forces. The launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1905 started the naval evolution, whose uniform caliber marked the advent of central fire control and changed the rule of naval combat. Other powers developed their dreadnoughts in merely four years. But they were soon outdated when Britain first achieved superfire structure on HMS Orion, which King George V- and Iron Duke-class also followed such layout.\n\nStarting from HMS Invincible, battlecruiser was invented, laying a foundation for fast battleships. In 1912, Queen Elizabeth-class became its first attempt, with seven economical but slower Revenge-class (two were refitted as Renown-class) ordered to ensure superiority over Germany.\n\nThe Royal Navy entered the war with its Two-Power Standard, owning the largest fleet globally. Britain and Germany have engaged in some indecisive battles during the first two years of the war trying to maintain the sea power, but the battle at Jutland in 1916 changed everything. Ending with both sides claiming victory, the Royal Navy still held strategic advantages by enforcing its blockade against German war machine, but the battle also exposed flaws in its ships. In the face of heavy losses in Jutland, the Royal Navy started to review its on-going battlecruiser programs, pausing the production of Admiral-class.\n\nAlthough the Royal Navy stood unchallenged on the sea, the cracks appeared on the land. With Russian Empire collapsing into a civil war in late-1917, the Entente was in desperate need of support from the New World, but the United States kept its state of neutrality. When the truce was signed between UK and Germany in 1919, it guaranteed British dominance over its colonies, but this was the only silver lining for the British Empire.\n\nImmediately after Germany's post-war naval expansion was passed, the Admiralty estimated that the Royal Navy would be behind in ships by 1922, and it urged the Director of Naval Construction to issue available designs as soon as possible. The DNC only had limited time before the review, hence a unified design of battleship (N3) and battlecruiser (G3) was pursued. The plan was to build two battleships and two battlecruisers in 1922, and do that again in 1923. In March 1922, Magnificent and Majestic were laid in Devonport, followed by two Nelson-class. Equipped with 18\" and 16\" guns respectively, Magnificent and Nelson makred Britain's superiority in ships once again like 20 years ago. Together with them, four Blenheim-class large cruisers were ordered, as an economical option to strengthen the battlecruiser fleet.\n\nAt the same time, the Royal Navy also embraced naval aviation with its precursor dating back to HMS Argus in 1918. In early-1924, three Courageous-class battlecruisers underwent carrier conversion, but largely abandoned due to the British Revolution."

 naval_lore_desc_2_can: "Influenced by shrinking market, the imperial finicial state had deteriorated year after year into recession. With the United Kingdom deep in debt, and the current state of affairs failing to improve the economy, the National Government headed by Austen Chamberlain proposed a fiscal austerity bill to cut pays in armed forces and further investment into the naval race.\n\nWhen the bill was passed in May 1924, shipyards across Great Britain went silent, and streets were filled with workless people. On May 18, HMS Hood returned to Plymouth after a tour of dominions with HMS Repulse. Learning of the pay cuts, the crew went mutinous. Government's suppression evoked anger across the island, and strikes were organized nationally. What started as clashes between the police and workers were quickly escalated to a full-out civil war.\n\nUpon the start of revolts, crewmen were taken away from their units for quarantined investigations to root out syndicalist sympathizers in the navy. However, the days of monarchy were numbered as royalists lost control of Scotland and Wales. On Christmas Eve 1925, when London citizens found Communal flags flying in the streets, French commando and Republicans had already taken most parts of England in a combined offensive. Relying on the line of defense near Plymouth and Southampton, Royal Navy launched the largest evacuation in history, escorting thousands of nobles, troops, and civilians to Canada.\n\nThe evacuation was hasty that few ships under construction were completely destroyed. The navy managed to pull out three of Magnificent-class, with HMS Venerable stranded in the Firth of Clyde and destroyed, while only one Nelson-class, HMS Drake, escaped successfully. Without orders from London, the China Station abandoned colonies after learning about approaching German fleet, and left for Australia, becoming part of the Royal Australasian Navy.\n\nCanada ascended to have one of the largest naval forces almost overnight after the arrival of exiles. Despite a strong presence on the Atlantic, the Royal Navy was on the edge of collapse due to limited budget and had not seen any new ships since 1925. It was then reinforced by four Moncton-class cruisers in 1933, but most of its obsolete dreadnoughts were left in poor conditions. Given that the public revenue was insufficient to maintain the Grand Fleet, Canadian officials forced decommission of several capital ships to carry the day.\n\nEven worse, the navy's chain of command was as chaotic as the government itself, with two naval commands directing the navy at the same time. Looking back at its glorious history, it's uncertain how much pride still left within the Royal Navy. If the Commonwealth could join their hands once again like 20 years ago, perhaps there's still a chance."

Government's suppression evoked anger across the island, and strikes were organized nationally. What started as clashes between the police and workers were quickly escalated to a full-out civil war.\n\nThe Republican Navy was non-existent at first, but with more soldiers and ships joining the revolution, it grew into a considerable size in late-1925. Inheriting most obsolete ships, the Republican Navy was not even operational in the 1920s due to lack of experienced officers and engineers. To relieve the workers, NCC (Naval Construction Committee) decided to renovate Renown- and Courageous-class, and resume the construction of remaining Nelson-class. Most of these works continued until the 1930s.\n\nWith internal situation stabilized, the Republican Navy initiated a large scale of modernization in 1931. Mainly composed of young talented officers, the naval command was quite interested in naval aviation, and promoted the creation of Republican Aviation School on the basis of Royal Aero Club in 1930. The Union's first effort to build an aircraft carrier was the conversion of HMS Victorious, the only member of Magnificent-class in Britain. In 1934, RNS Rebecca was completed on the 20% finished hull of Victorious, becoming the largest carrier in the world. It was followed by two Republic-class fleet carriers just a year later.\n\nRepublican Navy was established upon a group of battleships built before the war, with the latest one being RNS Leveller, former HMS Queen Elizabeth. It was reinforced by three Nelson-class battlecruisers in 1931, but their were actually designed in the late 1910s and had already shown incompetence in protecting carriers. The navy decided to change that by developing new battleships. Two Union-class battleships were ordered in 1932. Largely referring designs such as Nelson and remaining documents of I3 project, they were equipped with nine 18in guns and could sail at 30kn, but the sacrifice of armor revealed that they were still influenced by the legacy of John Fisher. To get rid of that, two pairs of Bondfield-class battleships were built with better armor and anti-air guns, but back to 16in guns. Alongside them, Measureless-class cruisers and squads of new destroyers became reliable escorts for the fleet.\n\nIt's undeniable that Republican Navy is at the first line of navies, but how effective is the form of naval warfare centered around aircraft carriers still remains unknown in 1936."

 naval_lore_desc_1_usa: "In 1890, The Influence of Seapower Upon History by Alfred Mahan was published. It discussed the various factors needed to support and achieve sea power, with emphasis on having the largest and most powerful fleet. For the United States, the theory justified investment in the navy, allowing expansionism to gaze at farther frontiers from the Caribbean to the Pacific.\n\nIn 1901, the election of Theodore Roosevelt was considered a milestone to the US Navy. Influenced by the Russo-Japanese War and the launch of HMS Dreadnought, he gave greenlight to the naval expansion, and achieved the global tour of Great White Fleet in 1907, heralding the rise of US naval power. By 1914, US had commissioned over 10 dreadnoughts in just 8 years.\n\nAmerica observed a strict neutrality during the war, and its international arms trade with both sides of the war led to plenty of cash flowing towards Washington. The economic boom contributed to its naval expansion. In an attempt to build the largest navy in the world, American naval theorists believed a mediocre but unified design should be pursued to simplify fleet command and maximize efficiency. Shortly after the outbreak of war in Europe, the first group of standard-type battleships, Nevada and Oklahoma were launched, bringing innovations such as triple guns and all-or-nothing armor scheme. They were followed by two Pennsylvania-class in a few months. As the war in Europe raging, the United States decided to stick with Standard-Battleship strategy, and steadily laid down more new ships, but they were mostly copies of previous designs with few modifications. Increasing naval budget led to complaints from Congress, and prompted Senator Benjamin Tillman to ask for a maximum battleship to end the naval race once and for all.\n\nHowever, the Naval Act of 1916 (Big Navy Act) had been signed by President Wilson before Tillman's proposal could even be considered, and it called for the construction of ten battleships and six battlecruisers to build \"incomparably, the greatest Navy in the world\". Foreseeing developments of European navies, the General Board wanted to depart from the standard series and build faster ships, but the Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels, overruled them and denied any radical modifications on Tennessee-class. It released the signal that USN would still abide by the standard-type strategy regardless of naval innovation happening across the Atlantic.\n\nAs the war drew to an end, the Colorado-class laid in 1917 and 1918 mostly remained repeats of earlier battleships except eight 16in guns. With four ordered, they would unexpectedly become the last members of the standard series. In early 1919, the navy initiated projects of six South Dakota-class battleships and six Lexington-class battlecruisers intensively as planned in the naval act. Unlike the standard series, their designed speeds (23kn for South Dakota, 33kn for Lexington) were set to match European counterparts. If all went well, they would be cornerstones of USN in the future.\n\nDespite losses of its favored side in the war, America's industry had continued to flourish into the early 1920s. Facing an intensifying naval race on the other side of the Atlantic, the United States Navy stayed vigilant, but a cut in naval funding from the newly-elected President McAdoo had made the progress of ships slower than expected."
 
 naval_lore_title_2_usa: "§HGod Bless America, United States Navy: 1920-1936§!"
 naval_lore_desc_2_usa: "Not long after members of South Dakota-class were close to completion, the United States Navy was shocked by the news that British and German were planning to build ships with 18in guns, which would make theirs outclassed by the time they enter service. The navy had to work on new designs and proposed an amendment to the original plan.\n\nWith several rounds of debates between navy and opposition senators, the new bill was narrowly passed by Congress to collect money for new battleships competitive to British and German designs. In April 1922, shortly after HMS Magnificent laying her keel, the United States quickly placed an order of five South Carolina-class, a design based on \"Maximum Battleship\" IV-2 and equipped with twelve 18-inch guns in four turrets, making America the second country in the world to build super heavy dreadnoughts.\n\nNonetheless, an economic crisis hit the United States when shipyards were operating at full power. Before that, looming tensions on the British Isles had put the New York stock market in decline throughout 1924. Covered by bubbles of prosperity, it was a large number of bad debts from excessive issuance of consumer loans by big banks on the Wall Street, and they finally burst at the outbreak of the British Revolution. On 20 April 1925, the NYSE took the largest plunge in its history at the open bell, making countless companies and individuals go bankrupt. The collapse of stock market immediately impacted banking when millions of people trying to withdraw their money found banks were already out of cash. The event, which led to a horrible chain reaction that totally destroyed America's economy, was known as the Great Depression.\n\nIn the face of the crisis, the Hoover administration applied fiscal austerity measures, and suspended most naval programs including South Carolina, which only 3 of its class had been finished until 1929. That was when aircraft carriers caught the navy's eye. It is generally believed that American research on naval aviation started in 1910 when civilian pilot Eugene Ely took off from USS Birmingham in a Curtiss Model D. In 1920, USS Langley was converted from a coaler and became the first US aircraft carrier. With little budget and consideration that battlecruisers were too weak against ships built during the naval race, USS Ranger and USS Constellation underwent carrier conversion in the 1920s. They were later followed by USS Massachusetts, the last member of South Dakota which was suspended in early-1922 due to construction of the super heavy dreadnought, USS South Carolina. On the bright side, these carriers accelerated the doctrinal evolution in the navy.\n\nAgainst all odds, shipyards managed to finish ships built before the Great Depression in the 1930s, while other projects planned in the Big Navy Act were in most abandoned due to lack of funds. Cruiser was the largest ship built by US during this period, with six Northampton-class heavy scout cruisers built in the mid-1920s and two Pensacola-class in the early-1930s. Their commission became one of the few comforts for the USN in the years of Great Depression.\n\nAs for now, the United States struggles to maintain its two-ocean navy. However, whether it can prevail in a potential war against the German Empire or an ambitious Japan remains a question."

 naval_lore_desc_1_fra: "Founded in the 17th century, the French Navy was one of the oldest navies still in continual service, with precursors dating back to the Middle Ages. It has taken part in key events in history including the Napoleonic War and Weltkrieg, and played an important role in establishing and securing the French colonial empire for 400 years. The French Navy pioneered several innovations in naval technologies, such as the first ironclad and first mechanically propelled submarine.\n\nHowever, the development of French Navy slowed down when naval races between the United Kingdom and Germany grew in intensity. It entered the 20th century with only a dozen of pre-dreadnoughts in service. Dreadnoughts, however, appeared in the navy upon the start of the war, with Courbet entered the service in 1913 and Bretagne in 1916. They should have been followed by five Normandie-class in 1913, the only warships to adopt quadruple batteries at that time, but the war in most suspended them.\n\nWith overwhelming pressure on the land, the naval production was hampered during the war. As arranged pre-war, the Royal Navy would focus on the North Sea, while the French was responsible for the Mediterranean theatre, where they mostly kept watch on the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Once Italy entered the war on the Allied side in May 1915, French navy moved to more forward bases at Brindisi on the Italian Adriatic coast and the Greek island of Corfu. From there, it launched an amphibious invasion on Athens in 1916, forcing the pro-German Greek government to side with the Entente. French destroyer squadrons also played an important role in countering Germany's U-boat campaign by regularly patrolling the seas and escorting convoys.\n\nWhen the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, France was on the brink of a civil war as anarcho-syndicalist riots swept across most parts of the country. Germany, however, secretly provided the syndicalists with arms and money to further destabilize France. The strategy, similar to what Germany used in Russia, was all but successful in the long term, which eventually unleashed a syndical menace in the near future.\n\nWanting a nation-wide negotiation with the Provisional Government on workers' treatment, the leaders of CGT (General Confederation of Labour), the most influential socialist party in France, were rational and tried to prevent the radical Jacobins, who appealed a violent revolution led by Bolsheviks, from launching attacks. The establishments lost all their patience when mild leftists failed to stop the escalation of crisis, which ultimately led to the French Civil War."

Neither happened, and the Commune was recognized as the legitimate successor to the Republic by Germany and members of Mitteleuropa.\n\nThe government-in-exile arrived at North Africa in June 1920 escorted by loyal members of the Mediterranean Fleet, waiting to take back the mainland one day. However, the African colonies lacked basic industries and manpower to build an army. In the early 1920s, the main forces of National Navy were two Courbets, two Bretagnes, and a couple of pre-dreadnoughts. It could rely on dockyards in Ferryville and Dakar to maintain some of light ships, but the rest were rapidly aging.\n\nFacing more and more tense confrontations off the coast of Corsica, the National Navy was forced to place orders for ships to prepare for a possible invasion of mainland. It seized the opportunity when the political and diplomatic air began to change in Europe.\n\nWith the British Isles fractured in revolution, old powers in Europe were keeping a watchful eye and lifted restrictions of arms exports. Among them, Two Sicilies was known for its busy shipyards and willingness to export warships to former Entente members. The first ships ordered by exiles were six 17,500-ton Pothau-class cruisers, with only Pothau herself finished due to exiles' poor finicial condition. Laid down in Naples, 1924, it was armed with two triple 330mm turrets forward of the bridge, and was completed in 1927.\n\nOut of strategic reason, the Austro-Hungarian Empire also gave greenlight to one of its largest naval contractors, STT (Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino), to export a couple of battleships in exchange for French capital assets in Italy and Balkan. Laid in 1933, the resulting battleships, Union Sacrée and France, were armed with nine 380mm guns, referencing Austrian design of Hunyadi-class to a large extent. To purchase them, the Republic has almost exhausted all its foreign exchange reserve.\n\nDespite all this, the exiles were too vulnerable to take on the syndicalists alone. After the collapse of British Empire, the remnants of the Entente Cordiale were marginalized globally, and it seemed that the return to motherland would never come. However, with intensifying situation in Europe, the exiles will bide their time. When the final struggle arrives, the National Navy will become the spearhead of the Republic."

 naval_lore_desc_2_fra: "During the civil war, the French navy was divided as was the rest of the nation. There were some engagements between nationalist and syndicalist naval units, but most of the ships remained in their ports as fuel was scarce and crews divided. When the war was over, ships stayed in mainland France became backbone of the newborn French People's Liberation Navy, or Marine de libération du Peuple.\n\nCommunal navy has two main fleets based in Brest and Toulon, and is relatively undeveloped. Its major mission is patrolling territorial waters and preventing landings into French coasts, instead of projecting influence abroad. Except for insurgent ships, the Communal Navy also tried to finish the Normandie-class in the 1920s. However, the naval race had rendered its design powerless against German ships. In the end, limited budgets led to that only two of them were finished, one as battleship, and the other as aircraft carrier Eugène Pottier.\n\nThe old doctrine gradually changed after the establishment of Union of Britain, and the Commune transformed its navy into an offensive force, targeting German Empire in its weakest point - supply lines from colonies powering its war machine. Centered around logistic raiding, France developed a few types of light ships. In 1927, France, togethter with Socialist Italy, launched the modern cruiser programs, and proposed two types of raider cruisers, the Rennes-class and better armored Lyon-class. They were grouped with squadrons of large destroyers, such as the Communard-class, to ambush convoys on the Atlantic. Witnessing successful German submarine warfare in the 1910s, France also emphasized on developing its submarine fleet which was represented by one of the deadliest, the Émeraude-class.\n\nCorresponding to British fleet renewal programs, French also started theirs in the 1930s, though the programs were quite limited in scale compared to British allies. The naval strategy of the Third Internationale in most repeated that of Anglo-French Alliance during the Weltkrieg, which made Austrian and German squadrons in the Mediterranean major enemies of French navy. In an effort to update its aging capital ships, the Commune ordered two Internationale-class in 1932 and assigned them to the Mediterranean Fleet. They were later reinforced by Le Fantasque- and Verdun-class destroyers in 1935. On the other hand, four Charles Fourier-class large cruisers were laid in late-1933. They would join the Atlantic Fleet for hunting down isolated scout ships and convoys.\n\nFor a long time, navy has been a small branch of Communal military forces, but it has been improving. Bearing hopes from proletariat of the world, the red Gallic Rooster will rise and shine."
 
 
 RUS_naval_lore: "History of Russian Navy"
 naval_lore_title_1_rus: "§HElegy of the Double Eagle, Imperial Russian Navy: 1900-1917§!"
 naval_lore_desc_1_rus: "Formally established in 1696, the Imperial Russian Navy lasted until dissolved in the wake of the February Revolution of 1917. It developed from a smaller force that had existed prior to Tsar Peter the Great's founding of the modern Russian navy during the Second Azov campaign in 1696. It expanded in late 18th century and reached its peak strength by the early part of the 19th century, behind only the British and French fleets in terms of size.\n\nHowever, Russia's slow technical and economic development in the 19th century caused her to fall behind other European countries in the field of steamboat. The glory of her navy was crushed and humiliated after swallowing a bitter defeat in the Tsushima Strait during the Russo-Japanese War, making Russia the only European country that lost to Asian in a full-out war. At the end of the war, Russia fell from the third greatest naval power to sixth place. The focus of the Russian navy then shifted from the Far East to the Baltic, defending Petersburg from the German Empire.\n\nIn 1907, a naval expansion program was put before the Duma but voted down, yet the later Bosnian Crisis forced reconsideration. Facing an inevitable German-Austrian alliance, Russia felt threatened by Austria's bolder actions targeting Serbia, a close ally of Russia. Four Gangut-class battleships were laid down in 1909 to phase out the pre-dreadnoughts in the navy and guard the Gulf of Finland. Delivered before the war, the turrets and fire controls of Ganguts were barely finished in mid-1915. Meanwhile, three similarly designed Imperatritsa Mariya-class were built for the Black Sea Fleet in response to the worsening relationship with Ottoman. The rearmament program included a significant element of foreign participation with several ships (including the cruiser Rurik) and machinery ordered from foreign firms. After the outbreak of Weltkrieg, ships and equipment being built in Germany were confiscated, and those from the United Kingdom was slow in reaching Russia or was diverted to the Western Allies' own war effort.\n\nIn the course of the war, Russian navy engaged Germany and Ottoman on two fronts. With the German fleet larger and more modernized in the Baltic, the Russian navy played a defensive role, at most attacking German convoys and laying mines. However, with a larger fleet based in Sevastopol, the Black Sea has become Russia's domain, and it was led by two skilled commanders: Admiral Eberhart and Admiral Kolchak. Their arts of commanding brought the Turkish with heavy losses, securing sea supremacy for Russia in this area. The greatest loss suffered by the Black Sea fleet was the destruction of the battleship Imperatritsa Mariya, which blew up in port on 7 October 1916.\n\nEven though Russia in 1916 still had the strength to launch decisive campaigns like the Brusilov Offensive, it had already reached the breaking point when the famine and countless coffins from the frontline frustrated every Russian. With people losing faith in the Tsar's regime, there were large-scale protests in the capital region, forcing the Tsar to abdicate. This is known as the February Revolution."
 naval_lore_title_2_rus: "§HAurora over the North, Soviet/Russian Navy: 1917-1936§!"
 naval_lore_desc_2_rus: "Without a centralized power structure, the provisional government became unpopular immediately after it decided to continue the war on the Entente side. Although Russia's military forces were already crumbling, it still possessed a formidable size. Germany, as a result, found that putting an end to the eastern front was necessary. It launched massive offensives in Eastern Europe and the Gulf of Riga in 1917, trying to force Russia out of the war.\n\nThe high hopes felt across Russia following the February Revolution had diminished to almost nothing by the closing weeks of 1917. The Provisional Government's ineffectual policies and weak authority in the face of the Petrograd Soviet had left the capital paralyzed with incessant street fighting and political turmoil. An attempted \"March on Petrograd\" by General Lavr Kornilov in August demonstrated the army's willingness to restore order, but President Alexander Kerensky has instead made the disastrous mistake of freeing the Bolsheviks to protect the city.\n\nDespite the conspiracy that Germany was behind the return of Vladimir Lenin, communism became quite popular among workers and soldiers. The antagonism felt betweem soldiers and their officers, workers and authorities, has finally led to the October Revolution and the brutal Russian Civil War.\n\nMost sailors sided with the Bolsheviks, but their ships remained in port due to shortage of fuel. With the communists controlling key industrial regions, the anti-Bolsheviks factions also put up their fights to unite Russia. Typically referred as the White Army, they were never united as a whole and were weak compared to the Red Army. However, after the assassination of Lenin, Germany started to send aid and personnel to the Whites fearing the exportation of Bolshevik revolution, which granted the Whites an edge over the Reds. In 1920, the victorious White Army signed the Treaty of Minsk with Germany to re-ratify the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk right after the siege of Moscow, ending the 3-year civil war.\n\nThe Eastern European states of the former Russian Empire achieved their independence, and were absorbed into Germany's military alliance, the Reichspakt. With Sevastopol in the hand of Ukraine, it inherited quite a few combat ships of the former Black Sea Fleet, including Imperatritsa Mariya- and Evstafi-class battleships, while a few destroyers were returned to Russian Republic as a symbol of friendship.\n\nRussian navy has experienced a period of shrinking throughout the 1920s, with most of its outdated ships scrapped or sold. Despite being backward compared to other naval powers, it was reinforced with a few new warships. The construction of two Izmail-class battlecruisers continued in mid-1925 with German assistance as a reward for the most-favored-nation treatment, while others were sold. Completed in 1928, the Izmails were the largest ships in the fleet and armed with twelve 356mm guns. The Svetlana-class were the first modern light cruisers built by Imperial Russia and 90% completed when they were towed from Tallin to St. Petersburg in 1917. The Soviets expected to commission them in 1919, but they were laid up incomplete due to the disruptions of the civil war, which later fell into the hand of White Army and were finished in 1927.\n\nIn 1936, despite a strong presence in the Baltic and the Black Sea, the Russian Navy had few ships in the Barents and Pacific region. It would still take years before the Russian Navy gets back to its original place." 
 
 AUS_naval_lore: "History of Austro-Hungarian Navy"
 naval_lore_title_1_aus: "§HBattle for the Adriatic, k.u.k. Kriegsmarine: 1900-1920§!"
 naval_lore_desc_1_aus: "The Kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine, or in short k.u.k. Kriegsmarine, is one of the three branches of Habsburg military forces, and was not formally established until the 18th century. It had a long history of rivalry with Italian navy and took part in many battles in the War of Italian Independence.\n\nAs the dreadnought race raging between Britain and Germany, Austria and Italy were in a race of their own for domination of the Adriatic Sea. Upon the completion of HMS Dreadnought, Austria's naval architects, aware of the inevitable dominance of dreadnought battleships, presented their case of Tegetthoff-class to the War Ministry, in an attempt to match Italy's fleet. Although not everyone is interested in the naval expansion, it met a strong supporter in royalty, Archduke Ferdinand.\n\nHowever, the fragile peace in Europe was ended by a shot ringing across Sarajevo and Archduke Ferdinand lying in his blood. When his body was carried back to Austria aboard SMS Viribus Unitis, it prompted the empire to mobilize and send a strongly-worded ultimatum to Serbia, whose intelligence agency was believed to be behind the assassination. The tensions drew concerns from other powers and initiated a month of diplomatic manoeuvring, known as the July Crisis. Russia's warning was ignored by Austria, and it began shelling Belgrade on 28 July 1914, which marked the start of Weltkrieg.\n\nAustrian navy saw some action during the war, but prior to Italian entry spent much of its time in its major base at Pola, except for small skirmishes. While the surface fleet at most supported offensives on land with shore bombardments, the U-boat campaign on the Mediterranean Sea was such a success that it forced the Entente to block the Otranto Strait. In 1917, Capitan Miklós Horthy led an assualt on the barrage which ended surprisingly in Austria's favour, but his second attempt in June 1918 was doomed when the fleet was accidentally spotted by an Italian MAS boat, culminating in the sinking of SMS Szent István.\n\nIn the final days of the war, the Italian government tried to facilitate a peace deal with Austria by offering land and assets of war, including part of its navy. However, this decision went public and was immediately under attack from angry people, who would never tolerate such disgrace combined with thousands of lives lost in the war. As standoffs raging across its society, Italy fell into a state of anarchy before any official agreements could be reached with the Central Powers. To eliminate naval threats from Italy once and for all, Austria schemed a frogman attack on its naval bases, crippling two dreadnoughts, Conte di Cavour and Giulio Cesare. They were evaluated as unrepairable and waived by Italian authority after the civil war.\n\nDespite standing amongst victors of the Weltkrieg, the war revealed divisions of culture, class, and ideology within the Empire ever so clearly. Austria struggled in the first few years to put down inner unrests and restore orders in its military occupied zones of Northern Italy and Ukraine. The naval modernization was hampered due to these distractions, with only one Admiral Njegovan-class cruiser, an improved version of Helgoland, laid in 1919.\n\nTrailing far behind other naval powers, the Austro-Hungarian Empire almost stagnated in terms of navy, making it an insignificant player in the midst of the Second Naval Arms Race."
 naval_lore_title_2_aus: "§HA.E.I.O.U, k.u.k. Kriegsmarine: 1920-1936§!"
 naval_lore_desc_2_aus: "As tensions cooled down a little bit in the early 1920s, Kaiser Karl, following in the footsteps of the assassinated Franz Ferdinand, began trying to reform the multinational Austro-Hungarian Empire into something that could survive in the twentieth century, launched a series of large-scale reforms. The federalization met resistance from the nobility of Hungary, and was also affected by autonomy movements in Cisleithanian region, leading to little progress of the Kaiser's plan.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine, in the face of severe finicial state, stayed away from the heating naval race. It instead focused on screen ships and submarines with strategic consideration that large ships proved to be inefficient in narrow waters along Austrian and Croatian coast. As products of the Ersatz Huszár project and part of the post-war rearmament program, eight Dragoner-class destroyers were ordered in 1922.\n\nIn spite of internal debates about building expensive heavy ships, the navy still found it necessary to upgrade its fleet of merely three old dreadnoughts. Early in 1914, the government had approved to build four battleships for 1915-1918 naval program at the request of Anton Haus, Commander-in-Chief of the navy. Designed as the Ersatz Monarch, the constrcution of the four battleships, later Hunyadi-class, was suspended during the war. Although they were so close to be scrapped, Haus objected to a cancellation and in February 1915 a compromise was reached where construction would resume after the war. Finished in 1925, they were originally armed with ten 350mm guns and refitted with eight 380mm guns in 1930.\n\nHowever, Austria's naval development was brought down after the Hungarian parliament refused to finance their share of naval budget, forcing the navy to look for cheaper designs. The resulting Schwarzenberg-class was largely based on Hunyadi, weaker but faster, fitting ten 350mm guns in four turrets. Two of them were completed in 1933, while the funding of another two just started in late-1934.\n\nWith growing Communal naval strength in the Mediterranean, Austria felt threatened that it might face another blockade by French in an upcoming war. Four Meteor-class destroyers and a pair of Custozza-class cruisers were ordered in the 1930s to counter it. Meanwhile, a squadron of submarines were built with German technologies. Quiter than any Austrian submarines before, the U-120 class was made to operate in shallow waters.\n\nAs tensions mounting in Europe, Austria was vigilant to a nearing German-Franco conflict, while its old enemies were also making strength for the revenge. Although the Kriegsmarine was often neglected, it still remained as an important part of national defense for the Austro-Hungarian Empire in these uncertain times."
