 JAP_naval_lore: "History of Imperial Japanese Navy"
 naval_lore_title_1_jap: "§HLegacy of Tsushima, Imperial Japanese Navy: 1910-1925§!"
 naval_lore_desc_1_jap: "By the beginning of Sino-Japanese War, Japan had already built up considerable naval power with imported battleships. Victories over Qing and Russia at the turn of the 20th century marked a new dawn in Japan's regional hegemony and a rapid growth of its navy. Being the only nation in Asia with a significant naval presence, Japan fought alongside the United Kingdom and occupied most German possessions in the Pacific upon the start of the Weltkrieg.\n\nWithout a nearby battlefront, Japanese resources were diverted to naval construction. Once dwarfed by European, Japanese Navy had taken a leap since the commission of Kongo-class which first adopted uniform caliber used on dreadnoughts. Laid in 1912, the Fuso-class became its first effort to build dreadnoughts of western standard even with the flawed multi-turret design, and two Ise-class with revised layout were built three years later. Upon that, the Eight-Eight Fleet initiative was proposed by Naval General Staff to fund another four battleships in the following years. It started with two Nagato-class armed with eight 410mm guns in 1917, while two Tosa-class with an additional turret were ordered in 1920, with a top speed of 26kn for both. Alongside them were four Amagi-class battlecruisers, but Takao was destroyed in the 1923 Kanto Earthquake. A few squadrons of Kamikaze- and Mutsuki-class destroyers were then built to counter the threat from the United States Navy.\n\nAfter Japanese naval aviation began in 1912 with the establishment of the Commission on Naval Aeronautical Research, several seaplane carriers were converted from other vessels. The experience would be crucial in the design of Hosho, the first to be built from the keel up as an aircraft carrier.\n\nDespite the peace deal signed between the Entente and Central Powers in 1919, Japan refused to surrender what was gained in the war, but it eventually gave up in the 1921 Tsingtao Accord facing British and American pressure. The peace didn't halt Japan's naval expansion and it placed orders for four Kii-class in response to Germany's Preußen-class. However, they were soon outdated before commission as UK and Germany started to build battleships with 18-inch guns. It was then that \"Battleship M\" with twelve 460mm guns, later know as Aki-class, were laid, and yet it would all be in vain when the Great Depression reached Japan's shore in 1925. Just a year ago, Japan has sunk 70% of its military expenditure in the naval race, and it has become an unaffordable game for Japan's shaky finacial state. Fearing envy from the army and public opposition, Aki-class were scrapped and sold along with half-built Suruga and Omi. It was not until the end of 1920s that Kii and Owari were finally finished, four years behind schedule."

 naval_lore_desc_2_jap: "After its funds got cut in 1925, IJN entered a dark era in the face of imminent German interventionism in Asia. With two enemies in the Pacific region, Japan adopted the \"Decisive Battle\" doctrine which tried to annihilate intruding fleets in one major battle.\n\nHowever, the Combined Fleet was aging, and it was obliged to abandon all ambitious building plans for Kongo's substitute. Settling for the second best, a new type of cruiser was planned based on B65, a large cruiser designed for commanding night battles. The navy managed to reuse some old technologies from Kongo, and installed six 356mm guns on the original design. In 1929, Furutaka and Kako were orderd, followed by slightly tuned Aoba and Kinugasa in just a few months.\n\nMeanwhile, limited investment redirected navy's focus to destroyers. It had been a trend since the end of the war that destroyers and cruisers would become larger to overwhelm their rivals, and the Type-1924 built by Germany only made it more pronounced. To counter it, the Navy Technical Department proposed the Special-Type destroyers. The Fubuki-, Ayanami- and Akatsuki-class became known for their high speed and heavy armaments including six 127mm guns in three turrets and the infamous Type-93 oxygen torpedo. Despite their paper firepower, the lighter hull would soon expose problems of poor stability, which was improved in the construction of Shiratsuyu-class and the refit of defective ships.\n\nWith economy slowly recovering in the 1930s, the National Diet spared some budgets for navy, and it limped to restart fleet renovation in the upcoming Ship Replenishment Plans (Maru Keikaku), which would start in 1931, 1934 and 1937. The first plan included four Tokachi-class cruisers to balance the budget, with the carrier Ryujo putting an end to the decade-long neglect of naval aviation. The second plan started in 1934 and was centered around four Monobe-class cruisers, an upgraded version of Tokachi. Cheaper than their counterparts, Tokachi and Monobe were favored by navy for their versatility. Given the course changing in naval doctrine in 1934, Soryu was added to the plan to sustain air superiority, becoming Japan's first fleet carrier.\n\nAs soon as the Second Maru Keikaku was completed, Japan would once again engage in heavy investments of its navy and eventually become the naval superpower on the Pacific Ocean."

 naval_lore_desc_1_ger: "The Imperial German Navy embarked on a massive fleet expansion program right after the commission of HMS Dreadnought. Rising from a naval race with the United Kingdom, Germany had rapidly grown into the second-strongest naval power in the world. Its first dreadnought, SMS Nassau, was quickly outdated, and the same fate also had the Helgoland-class. From 1910 to 1914, Germany slowly caught up with Britain in terms of dreadnoughts, having König-class as its first super-dreadnought and a squad of well-protected battlecruisers. Even though the war forced the focus of military production to lean towards the army, four Bayern-class battleships and three Derfflinger-class battlecruisers were planned.\n\nDespite the tactical victory in Jutland, Germany failed to break Royal Navy's blockade, encouraging General Ludendorff to propose reopening the unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917. The Kaiser decided against him first but agreed to resume in late-1918 when the chance of war between Germany and US has already diminished. With adequate investment, SMS Württemberg and two Mackensen-class battlecruisers were commissioned in 1918. From there, the Reichstag approved new war funds in 1919 for four Preußen-class and three Yorck-class battleships.\n\nBy summer 1919, Allies' morale was crushed under advancing German boots, and France was forced to submit to German conditions in the Treaty of Versailles facing internal revolts. As the army demobilized and Ludendorff descending from power, the right wing in navy cried for an expansion on the excuse of protecting Germany from another blockade. Regardless of oppositions in the government, the 1920 Naval Act was forced through after a half-year long debate. In October 1920, shortly after the final member of Preußen-class was laid down, the navy was given greenlight to build four Siegfried-class and another two Yorck-class in the upcoming years.\n\nThe news went across the channel and shocked the British Admiralty. With fear of falling behind, the Royal Navy was provoked by Germany's ambitious plan, and hastened the designing of N3 and G3 projects (Magnificent & Nelson). They would be built in two batches from 1922 to 1923. To ensure superiority, they adopted advanced armor scheme and larger caliber than German counterparts, with 18\" on Magnificent and 16\" on Nelson. The construction not only met strong answer from Germany but also involved US and Japan in the shipbuilding frenzy.\n\nTo keep up with the British, the navy exploited its ties with the Kaiser. As a naval enthusiast, Wilhelm II was keen on the navy, and has been a firm supporter of naval expansion. While the funds from naval act would be used for Siegfried-class as promised, the Reichstag narrowly agreed to spare more money for five new battleships."

 naval_lore_desc_2_ger: "Following the commision of SMS Preußen and SMS Yorck, the second group of Siegfried and Yorck were put into construction in late-1922. Before long, ThyssenKrupp laid two Schleisien-class battleships after widening its largest dock in the close of 1922.\n\nAs the naval race escalating, the shocking news of British Revolution almost instantly ended it in 1924. Although Germany had little interest in intervening the British Isles, it took over British colonies oversea in Africa and Asia, and needed a global navy more than ever. Fortunately, the 1924 Naval Act was welcome among conservative governing coalition. Benefited from growing economy, plenty of funds for new battleships, cruisers and destroyers were collected.\n\nSince German navy has lost its greatest rival, the new budget was invested in its obsolete Asian Fleet against Japan. It would be a pair of battleships, Brynhild and Witege, a subclass of Siegfried but modified to fit infrastructure in Singapore. However, in an attempt to please the Kaiser, the 80,000-ton battleship armed with eight 20\" guns, SMS Kaiser Wilhelm was surprisingly approved by navy as a present to the Ruby Jubilee of Kaiser's coronation. Laid in 1925, it became the last battleship built during the Dreadnought Race and was finally finished in 1932. But the monster would suffer heavy malfunctions from complex structure throughout the 1930s, even the biggest battleship fanatics in navy had to admit that it's just a white elephant.\n\nGerman navy was hindered by massive dreadnought projects in the late-1920s. Besides slowly advancing those unfinished, it also developed several types of budget cruisers for its vast colonial empire, though the armored cruisers were special. The revival of armored cruiser was an interesting idea invented by Germany. With its intermidate firepower only inferior to battlecruisers, it provided an economical capital ship for German colonies overseas, making its presence stronger in distant waters.\n\nYet Germany almost stagnated in most naval innovations and had zero operational carrier by 1932, which was changed that year with the commision of Weser-class, a reluctant move to strengthen the scouting force. Designing failures and resource wasting in the construction of SMS Kaiser Wilhelm, however, drove reformists in the navy to advocate evolution of doctrines, and carrier was on the list but still not having enough attention. Even though the officers at home has only taken the first step to develop fast battleships such as Blücher, East Asian Fleet has become a test field for new tactics with a fleet centered around fast raiding ships and carriers.\n\nIn 1936, despite a formidable size, the Imperial German Navy is overly extended and desperately needs a change."

 naval_lore_desc_1_eng: "Possessing the largest navy in the Victorian Era, the United Kingdom had always been the strongest naval power since the mid-19th century, and led the naval development through its unparalleled technologies.\n\nIn the 1900s, Europe was on the brink of war when Germany's ambition to pursue a place in the sun threatened old colonial empires. The Royal Navy got unprecedented investments against expanding German forces. The launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1905 started the naval evolution, whose uniform caliber marked the advent of central fire control and changed the rule of naval combat. Other powers developed their dreadnoughts in merely four years. But they were soon outdated when Britain first achieved superfire structure on HMS Orion, which King George V- and Iron Duke-class also followed such layout.\n\nStarting from HMS Invincible, battlecruiser was invented, laying a foundation for future fast battleships. In 1912, Queen Elizabeth-class became its first attempt, with seven economical but slower Revenge-class (two were refitted as Renown-class) ordered to ensure predominance.\n\nProve to be ineffecftive in their protection, the Royal Navy reviewed its battlecruiser designs post-Jutland, thus puasing its capital ship production. Meanwhile, although Royal Navy stood unchallenged on the sea, the cracks appeared on the land. With Russian Empire collapsing into a civil war, the Entente was in desperate need of support from the New World, but the US stayed neutral. When the truce was signed with Germany in 1919, it guaranteed security of British colonies, but this was the only silver lining.\n\nImmediately after Germany's 1920 Naval Act was passed, the Admiralty estimated that the Royal Navy would be behind in ships by 1922, and the four Admiral-class would not be sufficient. The DNC only had limited time before the review, hence a unified design of battleship (N3) and battlecruiser (G3) was pursued, but it still left hidden trouble. The plan was to build two battleships and two battlecruisers in 1922, and do that again in 1923. In March 1922, Magnificent and Majestic were laid in Devonport, followed by two Nelson-class. Equipped with 18\" and 16\" guns respectively, Magnificent and Nelson makred Britain's superiority in ships once again like 20 years ago. Together with them, four Blenheim-class large cruisers were ordered to be an economical option for battlecruiser fleet.\n\nAt the same time, the Royal Navy also embraced naval aviation with its precursor dated back to HMS Argus in 1918. In early-1924, three Courageous-class battlecruisers underwent carrier conversion, but largely abandoned due to the British Revolution."

 naval_lore_desc_2_can: "Influenced by shrinking market, the imperial finicial state has deteriorated year after year into recession. With the United Kingdom deep in debt, and the current state of affairs failing to improve the economy, the National Government headed by Austen Chamberlain proposed a fiscal austerity bill to cut pays in armed forces and further investment into the naval race.\n\nWhen the bill was passed in May 1924, shipyards across Great Britain went silent, and streets were filled with workless people. On May 18, the HMS Hood docked at Plymouth after a tour of dominions with HMS Repulse. Learning of the pay cuts, the crew went mutinous. Government's suppression evoked anger across the island, and strikes were organized nationally. What started as clashes between the police and workers were quickly escalated to a full-out civil war.\n\nUpon the start of revolts, crewmen were taken away from their units for quarantined investigations to root out syndicalist sympathizers in the navy. However, the days of monarchy were numbered as royalists lost control of Scotland and Wales. On Christmas Eve 1925, when London citizens found Communal flags flying in the streets, French commando and Republicans had already taken most parts of England in a combined offensive. Relying on the line of defense near Plymouth and Southampton, Royal Navy launched the largest evacuation in history, escorting thousands of nobles, troops, and civilians to Canada.\n\nThe evacuation was hasty that few ships under construction were completely destroyed. The navy managed to pull out three of Magnificent-class, with HMS Venerable stranded in the Firth of Clyde and destroyed, while only one Nelson-class, HMS Drake, escaped successfully. Without orders from London, the China Station abandoned colonies after learning about approaching German fleet, and left for Australia, becoming part of the Australasian Royal Navy.\n\nCanada ascended to have one of the largest naval forces almost overnight after the arrival of exiles. Despite a strong presence on the Atlantic, the Royal Navy was on the edge of collapse due to limited budget and had not seen any new ships since 1925. It was then reinforced by four Moncton-class cruisers in 1933, but most of its obsolete dreadnoughts were left in poor conditions. Given that the public revenue was insufficient to maintain the Grand Fleet, Canadian officials forced decommission of several capital ships to save the expenditure, which the British fleet command was reluctant but submitted at last.\n\nEven worse, the navy's chain of command was as chaotic as the government itself, with two naval commands directing the navy at the same time. Sea is our only way home, but the fate of Royal Navy stays uncertain for now."

Inheriting most obsolete ships, the Republican Navy was not even operational in the 1920s due to lack of experienced officers and engineers. To relieve the workers, the NCC (Naval Construction Committee) decided to provide jobs by renovation of Renown- and Courageous-class, and resuming the Nelson-class. Most of these works continued until the 1930s.\n\nWith internal situation stabilized, the Republican Navy initiated a large scale of modernization in 1931. Mainly composed of young talented officers, the navy was quite interested in naval aviation, and promoted the creation of Republican Aviation School on the basis of the Royal Aero Club. Its first effort to build a carrier was the conversion of HMS Victorious, the only member of Magnificent-class left in Britain. In 1934, it was commisioned as RNS Rebecca, the largest carrier in the world, and joined with two Republic-class fleet carriers in 1935.\n\nBefore the modernization project, the Republican Navy was established upon a group of battleships built ahead of the Great War, with the latest one being RNS Leveller, former HMS Queen Elizabeth. While three Nelson-class alone were not enough to protect the carrier fleet, the navy decided to develop the next generation battleships. Largely referencing the Nelson and remaining documents on Design I3, Britain ordered two Union-class battleships in 1932, having 18in guns and top speed of 30kn at the same time. To achieve that, armor was sacrificed. Not long after, two pairs of Bondfield-class battleships were built with better armor but only used 16in guns. Alongside them, the Measureless-class cruisers and squads of new destroyers became reliable escorts for the fleet.\n\nNo one would doubt that the Republican Navy is at the first line of navies. The form of naval warfare centered around aircraft carriers might be the future, but it remains unknown in 1936."

 naval_lore_desc_1_usa: "In 1890, The Influence of Seapower Upon History by Alfred Mahan was published. It discussed the various factors needed to support and achieve sea power, with emphasis on having the largest and most powerful fleet. For the United States, the theory justified investments in the navy, allowing expansionism to gaze at farther frontiers from the Caribbean to the Pacific.\n\nThe election of Theodore Roosevelt in 1901 was considered a milestone to the US Navy. Influenced by the Russo-Japanese War and the launch of HMS Dreadnought, he gave the greenlight to the naval expansion and organized the global tour of Great White Fleet in 1907. By the commission of New York-class in 1914, the US had built ten dreadnought within 8 years.\n\nThe US observed a strict neutrality during the war, and its international trade led to plenty of funds for navy. It came to fruition as Nevada-class, the first standard-type battleships, and innovations such as triple guns and all-or-nothing armor scheme. They were followed by two Pennsylvania-class a few months into 1913. As the war in Europe raging, the US steadily laid down new ships with three New Mexico-class, copies of Pennsylvania. Increasing naval budget prompted Senator Benjamin Tillman to ask for a maximum battleship to end the naval race once and for all.\n\nHowever, the Naval Act of 1916 (Big Navy Act) was passed before Tillman's proposal could even be considered, and it called for the construction of ten battleships and six battlecruisers to build \"incomparably, the greatest Navy in the world\". Although the General Board wanted to depart from the standard series, the Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels, overruled them and denied radical improvements on Tennessee-class. It released the signal that the USN would still stick to the standard-type strategy regardless of naval innovation across the Atlantic.\n\nApart from eight 16in guns, the Colorado-class laid in 1917 and 1918 mostly remained repeats of earlier battleships. With four ordered, they would unexpectedly become the final members of the standard series. In 1920, the navy initiated projects of six South Dakota-class battleships and six Lexington-class battlecruisers intensively as planned in the naval act, and their high-speed designs has in fact deviated from the standard series. Barring accident, they would be cornerstones of the future USN.\n\nDespite the loss of its favored side in the war, American industry and enterprise continued to flourish into the early 1920s. Facing an intensifying naval race on the other side of the Atlantic, the US stayed vigilant, but a cut in naval funding from the newly-elected President McAdoo has made American's constructions progressing slowly."

 naval_lore_desc_2_usa: "As American got through the initial stage of South Dakota-class, they were shocked by information of British and German plans to build ships with 18in guns, which would make them outclassed by the time they entered service. The navy had to work on new designs and proposed an amendment to the original plan of naval programs.\n\nUpon debates between the navy and Congress, the new bill was narrowly passed on the premise that all South Dakota-class would be cancelled to collect money for new battleships competitive to British and German designs. In April 1922, shortly after HMS Magnificent was laid, the navy placed an order for five South Carolina-class, a design based on \"Maximum Battleship\" IV-2. With their twelve 18in guns, the US became the second nation in the world to build super dreadnoughts.\n\nNevertheless, an economic crisis hit the United States when shipyards were operating at full speed. Looming tensions in the United Kingdom had put the New York stock market in decline throughout 1924. Covered by the bubble of prosperity, it was a large number of bad debts from excessive issuance of consumer loans, and finally exploded at the outbreak of the British Revolution. On 20 April 1925, the NYSE took the largest recorded plunge in its history at the open bell, making countless companies and individuals go bankrupt.\n\nHit by the Great Depression, Lexington- and South Carolina-class were suspended, and that was when aircraft carriers caught the navy's eye. The US research on naval aviation started in 1910 when civilian pilot Eugene Ely took off from USS Birmingham in a Curtiss Model D. In 1920, USS Langley became the recognized starting point of US carriers. To save budget, USS Ranger and USS Constellation were the first to undergo carrier conversion, followed by USS Massachusetts later. On the bright side, they accelerated the evolution of doctrine within the navy.\n\nAgainst all odds, the shipyards managed to finish ships built before the Great Depression, while other projects listed in the Big Navy Act were in most abandoned due to lack of funds. Cruiser was the largest ship built by US during this period, with six Northampton-class heavy scout cruisers built in the mid-1920s and two Pensacola-class in the early-1930s. Their commission became one of the few comforts for the USN in the years of Great Depression.\n\nAs for now, the United States struggles to maintain its two-ocean navy. However, whether it can prevail in a potential war against the German Empire or an ambitious Japan remains a question."

 naval_lore_desc_1_fra: "Founded in the 17th century, the French Navy was one of the oldest navies still in continual service, with precursors dating back to the Middle Ages. It has taken part in key events in history including the Napoleonic War and Weltkrieg, and played an important role in establishing and securing the French colonial empire for 400 years. The French Navy pioneered several innovations in naval technologies, such as the first ironclad and first mechanically propelled submarine.\n\nHowever, the development of French Navy slowed down when naval races between the United Kingdom and Germany grew in intensity. It entered the 20th century with only a dozen of pre-dreadnoughts in service. Dreadnoughts, however, appeared in the navy upon the start of the war, with Courbet entered the service in 1913 and Bretagne in 1916. They should have been followed by five Normandie-class in 1913, the only warships to adopt quadruple batteries at that time, but the war in most suspended them.\n\nWith overwhelming pressure on the land, the naval production was hampered during the war. As arranged pre-war, the Royal Navy would focus on the North Sea, while the French was responsible for the Mediterranean theatre, where they mostly kept watch on the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Once Italy entered the war on the Allied side in May 1915, French navy moved to more forward bases at Brindisi on the Italian Adriatic coast and the Greek island of Corfu. From there, it launched an amphibious invasion on Athens in 1916, forcing the pro-German Greek government to side with the Entente. French destroyer squadrons also played an important role in countering Germany's U-boat campaign by regularly patrolling the seas and escorting convoys.\n\nWhen the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, France was on the brink of a civil war as anarcho-syndicalist riots swept across most parts of the country. Germany, however, secretly provided the syndicalists with arms and money to further destabilize France. The strategy, similar to what Germany used in Russia, was all but successful in the long term, which eventually unleashed a syndical menace in the near future.\n\nWanting a nation-wide negotiation with the Provisional Government on workers' treatment, the leaders of CGT (General Confederation of Labour), the most influential socialist party in France, were rational and tried to prevent the radical Jacobins, who appealed a violent revolution led by Bolsheviks, from launching attacks. The establishments lost all their patience when mild leftists failed to stop the escalation of crisis, which ultimately led to the French Civil War."

 naval_lore_desc_2_nfa: "As conditions grew untenable for the French government and the military high command, they eventually retreated from the mainland, choosing exile instead of surrender, hoping that this temporary situation would soon be resolved as the newly created Federation of Communes of France would undoubtedly either quickly collapse on itself, or be put down by the German Empire. Neither happened, and the Commune was recognized as the legitimate successor to the Republic by Germany and members of Mitteleuropa.\n\nThe government-in-exile arrived at North Africa in June 1920 escorted by loyal members of the Mediterranean Fleet, waiting to take back the mainland one day. However, the African colonies lacked basic industries and manpower to build an army. In the early 1920s, the main forces of National Navy were two Courbets, two Bretagnes, and a couple of pre-dreadnoughts. It could rely on dockyards in Ferryville and Dakar to maintain some of light ships, but the rest were rapidly aging.\n\nFacing more and more tense confrontations off the coast of Corsica, the National Navy was forced to place orders for ships to prepare for a possible invasion of mainland. It seized the opportunity when the political and diplomatic air began to change in Europe.\n\nWith the British Isles fractured in revolution, old powers in Europe were keeping a watchful eye and lifted restrictions of arms exports. Among them, Two Sicilies was known for its busy shipyards. The first ships ordered were six 17,500-ton Pothau-class cruisers, with only Pothau herself finished due to exiles' poor finicial condition. Laid down in 1924 and completed in 1927, it was armed with two triple 330mm turrets forward of the bridge.\n\nOut of strategic consideration, the Austro-Hungarian Empire also gave greenlight to one of its largest naval contractors, STT (Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino), to export a couple of battleships. The resulting Union Sacrée-class battleships, Union Sacrée and France, were armed with nine 380mm guns and laid in 1931, referencing Austrian design of Hunyadi-class to a large extent. To purchase them, the Republic has almost exhausted all its foreign exchange reserve.\n\nDespite all this, the exiles were too vulnerable to take on the syndicalists alone. After the collapse of British Empire, the remnants of the Entente Cordiale were marginalized globally, and it seemed that the return to motherland would never come. However, with intensifying situation in Europe, the exiles will bide their time. When the final struggle arrives, the National Navy will become the spearhead."

 naval_lore_desc_2_fra: "During the Civil War, the French navy was divided as was the rest of the nation. There were some engagements between the nationalist and the syndicalist naval units, but most of the ships remained in their ports as fuel was scarce and the crews divided. When war was over, ships stayed in France became the backbone of the newborn French People's Liberation Navy, or Marine de libération du Peuple.\n\nThe navy has two main fleets based in Brest and Toulon, and is relatively undeveloped, only for patrolling territorial waters and preventing landings into French coasts, instead of projecting influence abroad. Except for insurgent ships, the Communal Navy also tried to finish the Normandie-class battleships in the 1920s. But limited budgets led to that only two of them were finished, one as battleship, and the other as aircraft carrier Eugène Pottier.\n\nThe old doctrine gradually changed after the establishment of Union of Britain, and it transformed the navy into an offensive force, targeting German Empire in its weakest point - supply lines from colonies that drove its war machine. Centered around logistic raiding, France developed a few types of light ships. In 1927, France togethter with Socialist Italy launched the modern cruiser programs, and proposed two types of raider cruisers, the Rennes-class and better armored Lyon-class. They were grouped with squadrons of large destroyers, such as the Communard-class, to ambush convoys on the Atlantic. Witnessing successful German submarine warfare in the 1910s, France also emphasized on developing its submarine industry which was represented by one of the most deadly, the Émeraude-class.\n\nCorresponding to British fleet renewal programs, French also started theirs in the 1930s. In an effort to update its aging capital ships, the Commune ordered two Internationale-class in 1932 and assigned them to the Mediterranean fleet against the expanding National Navy. They were later reinforced by Le Fantasque- and Verdun-class in 1935, which has again broken the record of destroyer's tonnage. On the other hand, four Charles Fourier-class armored cruisers were ordered in late-1933. They would join the Atlantic Fleet for hunting down isolated scout ships.\n\nFor a long time, the navy has been a small branch of Communal military forces, but it is improving. Bearing hopes from proletariat of the world, the red Gallic Rooster will rise and shine."

 naval_lore_title_1_rus: "§HElegy of the Double Eagle, Imperial Russian Navy: 1900-1917§!"
 naval_lore_desc_1_rus: "Formally established in 1696, the Imperial Russian Navy lasted until dissolved in the wake of the February Revolution of 1917. It developed from a smaller force that had existed prior to Tsar Peter the Great's founding of the modern Russian navy during the Second Azov campaign in 1696. It expanded in late 18th century and reached its peak strength by the early part of the 19th century, behind only the British and French fleets in terms of size.\n\nHowever, Russia's slow technical and economic development in the 19th century caused her to fall behind other European countries in the field of steamboat. The glory of her navy was crushed and humiliated after swallowing a bitter defeat in the Tsushima Strait during the Russo-Japanese War, making Russia the only European country that lost to an Asian one. At the end of the war, Russia fell from the third greatest naval power to sixth place. The focus of the Russian navy then shifted from the Far East to the Baltic, defending Petersburg from the German Empire.\n\nIn 1907, a naval expansion program was put before the Duma but voted down, yet the later Bosnian Crisis forced reconsideration. Facing an inevitable German-Austrian alliance, Russia felt threatened by Austria's bolder actions targeting Serbia, a close ally of Russia. Four Gangut-class battleships were laid down in 1909 to phase out the pre-dreadnoughts in the navy and guard the Gulf of Finland. Delivered before the war, the turrets and fire controls of Ganguts were barely finished in mid-1915. Meanwhile, three similarly designed Imperatritsa Mariya-class were built for the Black Sea Fleet in response to the worsening relationship with Ottoman. The rearmament program included a significant element of foreign participation with several ships (including the cruiser Rurik) and machinery ordered from foreign firms. After the outbreak of Weltkrieg, ships and equipment being built in Germany were confiscated, and those from the United Kingdom was slow in reaching Russia or was diverted to the Western Allies' own war effort.\n\nIn the course of the war, Russian navy engaged Germany and Ottoman on two fronts. With the German fleet larger and more modern in the Baltic, the Russian navy played a defensive role, at most attacking German convoys and laying mines. The Black Sea was the domain of Russia with a large fleet based in Sevastopol, and it was led by two skilled commanders: Admiral Eberhart and Admiral Kolchak. The greatest loss suffered by the Black Sea fleet was the destruction of the battleship Imperatritsa Mariya, which blew up in port on 7 October 1916.\n\nEven though Russia in 1916 had the strength to launch the decisive Brusilov Offensive, it had already reached the breaking point when the famine and countless coffins from the frontline frustrated every Russian. With people losing faith in the Tsar's regime, there were large-scale protests in the capital region, forcing the Tsar to abdicate. This is known as the February Revolution."
 naval_lore_title_2_rus: "§HAurora over the North, Soviet/Russian Navy: 1917-1936§!"
 naval_lore_desc_2_rus: "Without a centralized power structure, the provisional government became unpopular immediately after it decided to continue the war on the Entente side. Although Russia's military forces were already crumbling, it still possessed a formidable size. Germany found that putting an end to the eastern front was necessary and launched massive offensives in Eastern Europe and the Gulf of Riga, trying to force Russia out of the war.\n\nThe high hopes felt across Russia following the February Revolution had diminished to almost nothing by the closing weeks of 1917. The Provisional Government’s ineffectual policies and weak authority in the face of the Petrograd Soviet had left the capital paralyzed with incessant street fighting and political turmoil. An attempted \"March on Petrograd\" by General Lavr Kornilov in August had demonstrated the army’s willingness to restore order, but President Alexander Kerensky had instead made the disastrous mistake of freeing the Bolsheviks to protect the city.\n\nDespite the conspiracy that Germany was behind the return of Vladimir Lenin, communism became quite popular among workers and soldiers, and finally led to the October Revolution and the brutal Russian Civil War.\n\nMost sailors sided with the Bolsheviks, and their ships remained in port due to shortage of fuel. With the communists controlling key industrial regions, the anti-Bolsheviks factions formed the White Army, but they were never united as a whole and were weak compared to the Red Army. However, after the assassination of Lenin, Germany started to send aid and personnel to the Whites fearing the exportation of Bolshevik revolution, which granted the Whites an edge over the Soviets. In 1920, the victorious White Army signed the Treaty of Minsk with Germany to re-ratify the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk right after the siege of Moscow, ending the 3-year civil war.\n\nThe Eastern European states of the former Russian Empire achieved their independence, and were absorbed into Germany's military alliance, the Reichspakt. With Sevastopol in the hand of Ukraine, it inherited quite a few combat ships of the Black Sea Fleet, including Imperatritsa Mariya- and Evstafi-class battleships, while a few destroyers were returned to Russian Republic.\n\nRussian navy experienced a period of shrinking throughout the 1920s, with most of the outdated ships scrapped or sold. It was reinforced with a few new warships, despite being backward compared to other naval powers'. The construction of two Izmail-class battlecruisers continued in mid-1925 with German assistance, while others were sold. Completed in 1928, the Izmails were the largest ships in the fleet and armed with twelve 356mm guns. The Svetlana-class were the first modern light cruisers built by Imperial Russia and 90% completed when they were towed from Tallin to St. Petersburg in 1917. The Soviets expected to commission them in 1919, but they were laid up incomplete due to the disruptions of the civil war, which later fell into the hand of White Army and were finished in 1927.\n\nIn 1936, despite a strong presence in the Baltic and the Black Sea, the Russian Navy had few ships in the Barents and Pacific region. It would still take years before the Russian Navy gets back to its original place."

 naval_lore_title_1_aus: "§HBattle for the Adriatic, k.u.k. Kriegsmarine: 1900-1920§!"
 naval_lore_desc_1_aus: "The Kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine, or in short k.u.k. Kriegsmarine, is one of the three branches of Habsburg military forces, and was not formally established until the 18th century. It had a long history of rivalry with Italian navy and took part in many battles in the War of Italian Independence.\n\nAs the dreadnought race raging between the United Kingdom and Germany, Austria and Italy were in a race of their own for domination of the Adriatic Sea. Upon the completion of HMS Dreadnought, Austria's naval architects, aware of the inevitable dominance of dreadnought battleships, presented their case of Tegetthoff-class to the War Ministry.\n\nThe fragile peace in Europe was ended by a shot ringing across Sarajevo and Archduke Ferdinand lying in his blood, it prompted the Empire to mobilize and send a strongly-worded ultimatum to Serbia, whose intelligence agency was believed to be behind the assassination. The tensions drew concerns from other powers and initiated a month of diplomatic manoeuvring, known as the July Crisis. Yet Austria ignored Russia's warning and began shelling Belgrade on 28 July 1914, which marked the start of Weltkrieg.\n\nThe navy saw some action during the war, but prior to Italian entry spent much of its time in its major base at Pola, except for small skirmishes. While the surface fleet at most supported offensives on land with shore bombardments, the U-boat campaign on the Mediterranean Sea was such a success that it forced the Entente to block the Otranto Strait. In 1917, Capitan Miklós Horthy led an assualt on the barrage which ended surprisingly in Austria's favour, but his second attempt in June 1918 was doomed when the fleet was by chance spotted by an Italian MAS boat, culminating in the destruction of SMS Szent István. In the final days of the war, before Italy completely fell into anarchy, Austria schemed a frogman attack on its naval base, crippling two dreadnoughts, Conte di Cavour and Giulio Cesare.\n\nDespite standing amongst the victors of the Weltkrieg, the war revealed divisions of culture, class, and ideology within the Empire ever so clearly. Austria struggled in the first few years to put down inner unrests and restore orders in its military occupied zones of Northern Italy and Ukraine. The naval modernization was hampered due to these distractions, with only one Admiral Njegovan-class cruiser, an improved version of Helgoland, laid in 1919.\n\nTrailing far behind other naval powers, the Austro-Hungarian Empire almost stagnated in terms of navy, making it an insignificant player in the midst of the Second Naval Arms Race."
 naval_lore_title_2_aus: "§HA.E.I.O.U, k.u.k. Kriegsmarine: 1920-1936§!"
 naval_lore_desc_2_aus: "As tensions cooled down a little bit in the early 1920s, Kaiser Karl, following in the footsteps of the assassinated Franz Ferdinand, began trying to reform the multinational Austro-Hungarian Empire into something that could survive in the twentieth century, launched a series of large-scale reforms. The federalization met resistance from the nobility of Hungary, and was also affected by autonomy movements in Cisleithanian region, leading to Kaiser's plan progressing slowly.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine, in the face of severe finicial state, stayed away from the heating naval race. It instead focused on screen ships and submarines with strategic consideration that large ships were proved to be inefficient in narrow waters. Eight Dragoner-class destroyers, products of the Ersatz Huszár project, were ordered in 1922, marking the start of the samll-scale naval rearmament program.\n\nIn spite of internal debates, the navy still found it necessary to update its fleet of merely three old dreadnoughts. Early in 1914, the government had approved to build four battleships for 1915-1918 naval program at the request of Anton Haus, Commander-in-Chief of the navy. Designed as the Ersatz Monarch, the constrcution of the four battleships, later Hunyadi-class, was suspended during the war. Although they were so close to be scrapped, Haus objected to a cancellation and in February 1915 a compromise was reached where construction would resume after the war.\n\nFinished in 1925, they were originally armed with ten 350mm guns and refitted with eight 380mm guns in 1930. But Austria's naval development was doomed after the Hungarian parliament refused to finance their share of the naval budget, forcing the navy to look for cheaper designs. The resulting Schwarzenberg-class was largely based on Hunyadi, weaker but faster, fitting ten 350mm guns in four turrets. Two of them were completed in 1933, while the funding of another two just started in late-1934.\n\nWith the growing Communal naval strength in the Mediterranean, Austria felt threatened that it might face another blockade by French during a potnetial war. Four Meteor-class destroyers and a pair of Custozza-class cruisers were ordered in the 1930s to counter it. Meanwhile, a squadron of submarines were built with German technologies. Quiter than any submarines before, the U-120 class was made to operate in shallow waters.\n\nAs tensions mounting in Europe, Austria was vigilant to a nearing German-Franco conflict, while its old enemies were also making strength for the revenge. Although the Kriegsmarine was often neglected, it still remained as an important part of national defense for the Austro-Hungarian Empire in these uncertain times."
