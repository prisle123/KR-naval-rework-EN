 naval_lore_title_1_jap: "§HLegacy of Tsushima, Imperial Japanese Navy: 1910-1925§!"
 naval_lore_desc_1_jap: "The Meiji Restoration's transformative impact on Japan's industry and culture laid the foundation for its emergence as a formidable naval power. By the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan had already acquired a significant fleet of imported battleships. Its decisive victories over Qing China (1894–1895) and Tsarist Russia (1904–1905) heralded Japan's ascendancy as a regional hegemon and marked the rapid modernization of its navy.\n\nInvoking the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, Japan declared war on Germany at the onset of the Weltkrieg and swiftly occupied German territories in the Pacific. With no immediate land conflict to divert resources, Japan focused on naval expansion. The acquisition of the Kongō—its first warship boasting super-dreadnought firepower—signaled Japan's departure from dependence on European naval supremacy. Soon after, Japan commenced domestic dreadnought production, launching two Fusō-class and two Isé-class battleships, the latter featuring an improved turret arrangement.\n\nIn 1917, the Naval General Staff unveiled the ambitious Eight-Eight Fleet initiative, a long-term plan to construct a battle fleet of eight modern battleships and eight battlecruisers. The program began with the Nagato-class, armed with eight 410mm guns, followed by the Tosa-class in 1920, which added a fifth turret. Japan's breakthroughs in steam turbine technology allowed these ships to achieve 26 knots, surpassing contemporary foreign designs. To support the battle line, four Amagi-class battlecruisers were ordered, though the 1923 Great Kantō Earthquake destroyed Amagi's hull, forcing its sister ship Takao to assume the name. Simultaneously, Japan bolstered its destroyer forces with Kamikaze- and Mutsuki-class squadrons, anticipating future confrontations with the United States Navy.\n\nJapan also emerged as an early innovator in naval aviation. The Commission on Naval Aeronautical Research, established in 1912, oversaw the conversion of merchant vessels into seaplane carriers during the war. These experiments culminated in the Hōshō, the world's first purpose-built aircraft carrier, commissioned in 1922.\n\nDespite the 1919 peace settlement, Japan initially refused to relinquish its occupied German Pacific territories, only conceding under Anglo-American pressure in the 1921 Tsingtao Accord. Undeterred, Japan pursued naval parity with Western powers, ordering four Kii-class battleships. However, these were soon outmatched by British and German designs mounting 18-inch guns. In response, Japan laid down the Aki-class (Battleship M), planned to carry twelve 460mm guns. Yet the Great Depression's arrival in 1925 crippled Japan's economy, which had already allocated 70% of its military budget to naval expansion. Facing fiscal collapse and domestic opposition, the Navy scrapped the Aki-class and two unfinished Kii-class hulls (Suruga and Ōmi). The lead ships, Kii and Owari, were completed four years behind schedule, a symbolic end to Japan's prewar naval ambitions."

 naval_lore_desc_2_jap: "Following severe budget cuts in 1925, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) entered a period of significant challenge as German expansionism loomed in Asia. Faced with potential threats from multiple directions in the Pacific, Japan adopted a defensive \"Decisive Battle\" doctrine, aiming to destroy invading fleets in a single, overwhelming engagement, which happens after battles of attrition led by high-speed battleships and torpedo ships.\n\nBy the late 1920s, the Combined Fleet was showing its age. The Kongō, Japan's oldest battleship, had been in service for over 15 years, and plans for its engine modernization were abandoned due to financial constraints. Forced to compromise, the Navy Technical Department repurposed older technologies from the Kongō to design a new class of large cruisers, the B65-type, intended to serve as night battle command ships. These vessels were armed with six 356mm guns, a modest but practical solution. In 1929, the Furutaka and Kako were ordered, followed shortly by the slightly improved Aoba and Kinugasa.\n\nWith limited funding, the IJN shifted its focus to lighter, more cost-effective vessels. Postwar trends had seen destroyers and cruisers grow in size and capability, a development underscored by Germany's Type-1924 destroyers. In response, Japan introduced the \"Special-Type\" destroyers—Fubuki-, Ayanami-, and Akatsuki-class—which featured heavy armaments, including six 127mm guns in three turrets and the formidable Type-93 oxygen torpedo. However, their high-speed design came at the cost of hull stability, a flaw later addressed in the Shiratsuyu-class and through refits of earlier models.\n\nAs Japan's economy began to recover in the 1930s, the National Diet allocated modest budgets to the navy, enabling gradual fleet modernization under the Ship Replenishment Plans (Maru Keikaku) of 1931, 1934, and 1937. The first plan included four Tokachi-class cruisers, designed to balance cost and capability, and the light carrier Ryūjō, marking the end of a decade-long neglect of carrier aviation. The 1934 plan prioritized four Monobe-class cruisers, an upgraded variant of the Tokachi, valued for their versatility and affordability.\n\nThe evolving naval doctrine of the 1930s placed greater emphasis on air power, leading to the commissioning of Sōryū in 1934, Japan's first purpose-built fleet carrier. By the completion of the Second Maru Keikaku, Japan had laid the groundwork for a resurgence in naval power, setting the stage for its eventual emergence as a Pacific superpower."

 naval_lore_title_1_ger: "§HHeil dir im Siegerkranz, Kaiserliche Marine: 1900-1922§!"
 naval_lore_desc_1_ger: "The Imperial German Navy initiated a massive fleet expansion program following the commissioning of HMS Dreadnought in 1906. This marked the beginning of a fierce naval race with the United Kingdom, propelling Germany to the position of the world's second-strongest naval power. However, the rapid evolution of battleship design rendered Germany's early dreadnoughts obsolete within years. Between 1910 and 1914, the Hochseeflotte gradually narrowed the gap with the Royal Navy, bolstered by the introduction of König-class battleships and a squadron of well-armored battlecruisers. Even as war loomed, Germany remained committed to challenging British dominance, with plans already underway for four Bayern-class battleships and three Derfflinger-class battlecruisers.\n\nThe tactical victory at Jutland in 1916 failed to break the Royal Navy's blockade, prompting General Ludendorff to advocate for the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917. Initially opposed by the Kaiser, the proposal was eventually approved in late 1918, by which time the threat of war with the United States had significantly diminished. With renewed investment, the SMS Württemberg and two Mackensen-class battlecruisers were commissioned in 1918, followed by two more in 1919. Early that year, the Reichstag allocated additional war funds for the construction of four Preußen-class battleships and three Yorck-class battlecruisers, signaling Germany's unyielding naval ambitions.\n\nBy the summer of 1919, the Entente's morale had collapsed under relentless German advances. The surrender of France, formalized in the Treaty of Versailles amid internal revolts, marked the end of the Western alliance. Yet, despite the war's conclusion, Germany's naval expansion stoked deep insecurity in Britain, prompting the Royal Navy to maintain the Grand Fleet. With the army demobilized and Ludendorff's influence waning, radical naval officers, leveraging ties with shipbuilding firms, pushed for further expansion under the pretext of safeguarding Germany from future blockades, leading the 1920 Flottengesetze (Fleet Laws) to be passed after six months of contentious debate. By October 1920, as the final member of Preußen was laid, the German Navy received approval to commence construction of the Yorck-class, a project spanning 1920–1921. These massive expenditures not only sustained Germany's industrial base but also averted a post-war economic crisis.\n\nNews of Germany's ambitious naval plans reached Britain, alarming the Admiralty and reigniting fears over the erosion of the Two-Power Standard. In response, the Royal Navy accelerated the design of next-generation warships—the N3 and G3 classes—scheduled for construction between 1922 and 1923. These vessels, featuring advanced armor schemes and formidable firepower (18-inch guns for the N3 and 16-inch for the G3), were intended to outmatch their German counterparts. Unsurprisingly, this move provoked strong reactions from Germany, US, and Japan, setting the stage for a renewed naval arms race.\n\nDetermined to keep pace with Britain, Admiral Tirpitz appealed to Kaiser Wilhelm II, a staunch advocate of naval expansion. Under the Kaiser's influence, additional funding for five new battleships was narrowly approved by the Reichstag. This decision underscored Germany's relentless pursuit of naval parity, even as the shadows of war receded."


 naval_lore_title_2_ger: "§HDeutschland über Alles, Kaiserliche Marine: 1922-1936§!"
 naval_lore_desc_2_ger: "By late 1922, Germany had commissioned its first post-war battleships, followed a year later by the Yorck-class. In response to Britain's HMS Magnificent, ThyssenKrupp expanded its largest dockyard to construct two Elsaß-class battleships, armed with nine 480mm guns. This achievement made Germany the third nation, after Britain and America, to field super-heavy dreadnoughts.\n\nThe escalating naval race strained the economies of major powers. The British Revolution of 1924 abruptly halted its participation, allowing Germany to seize several of its African and Asian colonies seeking protection from anti-colonial unrest. The sudden expansion of Germany's colonial empire placed immense pressure on its merchant navy and global logistics. Yet, with wealth flowing from these lucrative territories, the 1924 Flottengesetze was enthusiastically received by the conservative government, funding new battleships and cruisers. Four Siegfried-class battleships, modest upgrades of the Preußen-class, were ordered in 1925–1926 to replace obsolete pre-war vessels.\n\nWith Britain no longer a rival, Germany redirected its naval budget toward countering Japan's anti-German stance in Asia. This effort yielded two Yorck-derived battlecruisers, Schlieffen and Steinmetz, designed for Singapore's limited infrastructure. The remainder of the budget was lavished on a vanity project: the 80,000-ton SMS Kaiser Wilhelm, armed with eight 20-inch guns. Laid down in 1925 as a tribute to the Kaiser's Ruby Jubilee, its 1932 completion marked the end of the dreadnought race. Plagued by malfunctions, the ship was widely regarded as a white elephant, even by staunch battleship advocates.\n\nBy the late 1920s, Germany's navy was bogged down by colossal dreadnought projects. While these inched toward completion, the fleet turned to budget cruisers to patrol its vast colonial holdings. Among these, armored cruisers—a revived concept—stood out. Designed as economical capital ships for distant waters, they offered firepower just shy of battlecruisers, bolstering Germany's global presence.\n\nThe obsession with battleships left Germany lagging in naval innovation. By 1932, it had no operational carriers until the reluctant commissioning of the Weser-class, intended primarily for scouting as Zeppelins were retired from service. The debacle of SMS Kaiser Wilhelm spurred reformist calls for doctrinal change, though carriers remained a low priority. While the home fleet tentatively explored fast battleships like the Blücher, the East Asian Fleet became a testing ground for raiding tactics and carrier-centric operations—though their impact on Berlin's strategic thinking remained unclear.\n\nBy 1936, the Kaiserliche Marine was a formidable but overextended force, its structure straining under the weight of outdated ambitions and urgent need for modernization."
 
 ENG_naval_lore: "History of British Royal/Republican Navy"
 naval_lore_title_1_eng: "§HRule the Waves, Royal Navy: 1900-1925§!"
 naval_lore_desc_1_eng: "Throughout the Victorian Era and into the 20th century, the Royal Navy stood unchallenged as the world's preeminent naval force, its technological innovations setting the standard for maritime power. By the 1900s, however, Germany's rising ambitions threatened this dominance, prompting unprecedented British investment in naval expansion.\n\nThe launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1905 revolutionized naval warfare, introducing uniform-caliber guns and centralized fire control. While other powers scrambled to replicate this design, Britain maintained its lead with the Orion-class, which pioneered the superfiring turret arrangement later adopted by the King George V- and Iron Duke-classes. The Royal Navy further innovated with the battlecruiser concept, beginning with HMS Invincible, which laid the groundwork for future fast battleships. By 1912, Queen Elizabeth-class emerged as a powerful hybrid, while the slower but cost-effective Revenge-class (with two units later refitted as Renown-class battlecruisers) ensured numerical superiority over Germany.\n\nAt the outbreak of war, the Royal Navy's Two-Power Standard guaranteed its global supremacy. Early naval engagements with Germany proved indecisive, but the 1916 Battle of Jutland revealed critical vulnerabilities in British ship design. Despite maintaining strategic control through its blockade, the Royal Navy suffered heavy losses, leading to a reevaluation of its battlecruiser programs and the suspension of the Admiral-class.\n\nThe war's toll extended beyond the seas. The collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917 strained the Entente, and without American intervention, Britain's position grew precarious. The 1919 truce with Germany preserved British colonial dominance, but this was a fleeting consolation for an empire showing signs of strain.\n\nFaced with Germany's post-war naval expansion, the Admiralty recognized the looming threat of obsolescence. In response, the Director of Naval Construction prioritized a unified design strategy, producing the N3 battleships and G3 battlecruisers. By 1922, HMS Magnificent and HMS Majestic were laid down, followed by the Nelson-class, all armed with formidable 18-inch and 16-inch guns, respectively. These vessels reaffirmed Britain's naval supremacy, while the Blenheim-class large cruisers provided a cost-effective supplement to the battlecruiser fleet.\n\nThe Royal Navy also ventured into naval aviation, building on the pioneering HMS Argus (1918). In 1924, plans to convert the Courageous-class battlecruisers into carriers were initiated, though the British Revolution soon interrupted these efforts. Just before that, the Royal Navy remained a formidable force, yet the challenges of modernization and geopolitical shifts hinted at an uncertain future."

 naval_lore_desc_2_can: "By 1924, the British Empire found itself mired in economic crisis. Years of recession, compounded by mounting debt and dwindling markets, forced Austen Chamberlain's National Government to implement severe austerity measures. The resulting fiscal bill slashed military pay and halted naval expansion, plunging shipyards into idleness and leaving thousands unemployed.\n\nThe consequences were immediate and explosive. On May 18, 1924, the crews of HMS Hood and HMS Repulse, returning from a tour of the dominions, mutinied upon learning of the pay cuts. Government attempts to suppress the unrest backfired, sparking nationwide strikes that rapidly escalated into open revolt. As syndicalist sympathies spread, the navy purged its ranks, but the monarchy's fate was already sealed. By Christmas Eve 1925, royalist forces had lost control of Scotland and Wales, while French commandos and Republican insurgents overran much of England.\n\nIn a desperate last stand, the Royal Navy organized a chaotic evacuation from Plymouth and Southampton, ferrying nobles, troops, and civilians to Canada. The operation was so rushed that nearly all unfinished ships—including HMS Venerable of the Magnificent-class—were scuttled or abandoned. Only three Magnificent-class battleships and HMS Drake of the Nelson-class escaped intact. Meanwhile, the China Station, cut off from London, fled to Australia rather than face the approaching German fleet, merging with the Royal Australasian Navy.\n\nOvernight, Canada inherited the remnants of British naval power, though its newfound strength was illusory. Plagued by budget constraints, the exiled Royal Navy languished without new ships until the 1933 commissioning of four Moncton-class cruisers. Even then, most of its dreadnoughts remained in disrepair, and public funds proved insufficient to sustain the Grand Fleet. Forced to prioritize, Canadian officials decommissioned multiple capital ships, further eroding the navy's combat readiness.\n\nCompounding these challenges was a fractured chain of command, with rival naval authorities issuing conflicting orders. The once-proud Royal Navy, which had dominated the seas for a century, now teetered on the brink of irrelevance. Its future hinged on an increasingly unlikely reunion of the Commonwealth—a faint echo of the unity that had once secured Britain's unity and glory."

By Christmas Eve 1925, royalist forces had lost control of Scotland and Wales, while French commandos and Republican insurgents overran much of England.\n\nBorn from revolution in late 1925, the Republican Navy initially struggled with obsolete ships and a critical shortage of experienced personnel. Its early years were marked by inactivity as the fledgling force grappled with these limitations. The Naval Construction Committee (NCC) sought to address these challenges by renovating Renown- and Courageous-class battlecruisers and completing the remaining Nelson-class battleships—projects that would stretch well into the 1930s.\n\nBy 1931, with domestic stability achieved, the Republican Navy embarked on an ambitious modernization program. Its leadership, dominated by progressive young officers, prioritized naval aviation, establishing the Republican Aviation School in 1930 on the foundation of the former Royal Aero Club. This focus bore fruit in 1934 with the completion of RNS Rebecca, the world's largest carrier at the time, converted from the unfinished hull of HMS Victorious. Two Republic-class fleet carriers followed in 1935, signaling the navy's commitment to air power.\n\nThe surface fleet, however, revealed the navy's transitional state. Its backbone consisted of pre-war battleships like RNS Leveller (the former HMS Queen Elizabeth), supplemented by three outdated Nelson-class battlecruisers acquired in 1931. Recognizing their inadequacies, the navy ordered two Union-class battleships in 1932. These ships, armed with nine 18-inch guns and capable of 30 knots, paid for their speed with thin armor—a lingering echo of John Fisher's doctrine. Subsequent Bondfield-class battleships corrected this imbalance with improved protection and 16-inch guns, supported by modern Measureless-class cruisers and destroyer squadrons.\n\nBy 1936, the Republican Navy had undeniably joined the ranks of the world's leading naval powers. Yet, as its carrier-centric doctrine took shape, the effectiveness of this untested approach remained an open question—one that would soon be answered by the tides of war."

 naval_lore_desc_1_usa: "The publication of Alfred Mahan's The Influence of Seapower Upon History in 1890 provided the intellectual foundation for U.S. naval expansion, justifying investments that would propel American power from the Caribbean to the Pacific.\n\nThis vision gained momentum under President Theodore Roosevelt, whose administration, inspired by the Russo-Japanese War and Britain's HMS Dreadnought, authorized a rapid naval buildup. By 1914, the U.S. had commissioned over 10 dreadnoughts in just eight years, a feat underscored by the global tour of the Great White Fleet in 1907.\n\nThe war marked a turning point. While maintaining neutrality, the U.S. profited from arms sales to both sides, fueling an economic boom that further bankrolled naval growth. American theorists championed a \"Standard-Type\" battleship strategy—uniform designs to streamline command and production. The Nevada- and Pennsylvania-classes embodied this approach, introducing innovations like triple turrets and \"all-or-nothing\" armor. Yet as war in Europe raging, Congress grew wary of escalating costs, prompting Senator Tillman to propose a single, maximum-capability battleship (known as the Maximum Battleship) to halt the arms race once and for all.\n\nThe Naval Act of 1916 signed by President Woodrow Wilson (Big Navy Act) ended such debates, authorizing 10 battleships and 6 battlecruisers to create, in his words, \"incomparably, the greatest Navy in the world\". While the General Board advocated faster designs to match European trends, Secretary Josephus Daniels insisted on incremental improvements, as seen in the Tennessee-class. By war's end, the Colorado-class—equipped with 16-inch guns but otherwise derivative—closed the Standard-Type era unpredictably.\n\nPostwar plans pivoted to the South Dakota-class battleships and Lexington-class battlecruisers, designed with speeds (23 and 33 knots, respectively) to rival foreign fleets. However, President McAdoo's 1920s budget cuts slowed progress, leaving the U.S. Navy at a crossroads: poised for dominance but constrained by fiscal and doctrinal inertia."
 
 naval_lore_title_2_usa: "§HGod Bless America, United States Navy: 1920-1936§!"
 naval_lore_desc_2_usa: "As the South Dakota-class battleships neared completion, the U.S. Navy received alarming reports of British and German plans for 18-inch-gunned super-dreadnoughts that would render American designs obsolete. Facing this threat, the Navy proposed an emergency amendment to its construction program. After heated Congressional debates, approval was narrowly granted in April 1922 for five Louisiana-class battleships - massive vessels carrying twelve 18-inch guns in four turrets, making the U.S. the second nation to build such super-heavy capital ships.\n\nThis ambitious expansion collided with growing economic instability. The New York stock market had been declining throughout 1924 due to tensions in Britain, and the British Revolution triggered a full financial collapse. On April 20, 1925, the NYSE experienced its worst crash in history, exposing the fragile foundation of excessive consumer debt and speculative banking practices. The resulting Great Depression devastated American industry and forced the Hoover administration to implement severe austerity measures.\n\nNaval programs were hit hard. Only three Louisiana-class ships were completed by 1929 with some parts still unfinished, while other projects from the 1916 Naval Act were abandoned. In this crisis, the Navy turned to more affordable alternatives. The conversion of existing hulls into aircraft carriers accelerated, including the South Dakota-class' USS Massachusetts and the battlecruisers USS Ranger and USS Constellation. These joined USS Langley, America's first carrier converted from a collier in 1920. While this fostered growing interest in naval aviation, the Navy's doctrine remained conflicted - officially maintaining battleships as the fleet's core while quietly developing carrier tactics.\n\nThe 1930s saw the completion of pre-Depression projects like the six Northampton-class and two Pensacola-class cruisers, providing some comfort to the struggling Navy. However, the dream of a dominant two-ocean fleet had faded. As Germany and Japan continued their naval expansions, questions loomed about America's ability to compete in a future conflict, with its navy caught between dwindling resources and the need to adapt to new technologies, and more importantly, growing political turmoils in Washington D.C.."

 naval_lore_desc_1_fra: "Founded in the 17th century, the French Navy was one of the oldest navies still in continual service, with precursors dating back to the Middle Ages. It has taken part in key events in history including the Napoleonic War and Weltkrieg, and played an important role in establishing and securing the French colonial empire for 400 years. The French Navy pioneered several innovations in naval technologies, such as the first ironclad and first mechanically propelled submarine.\n\nHowever, the development of French Navy slowed down when naval races between the United Kingdom and Germany grew in intensity. It entered the 20th century with only a dozen of pre-dreadnoughts in service. Dreadnoughts, however, appeared in the navy upon the start of the war, with Courbet entering service in 1913 and Bretagne in 1916. They should have been followed by five Normandie-class in 1913, the only warships to adopt quadruple batteries at that time, but the war in most suspended them.\n\nWith overwhelming pressure on the land, France's naval production was hampered during the war. Based on agreements made before, the Royal Navy would focus on the North Sea, while the French was responsible for the Mediterranean theatre, where they mostly kept watch on the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Once Italy entered the war on the Allied side in May 1915, French navy moved to more forward bases at Brindisi on the Italian Adriatic coast and the Greek island of Corfu. From there, it launched an amphibious invasion on Athens in 1916, forcing the pro-German Greek government to side with the Entente. French destroyer squadrons also played an important role in countering Germany's U-boat campaign by regularly patrolling the seas and escorting convoys.\n\nWhen the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, France was on the brink of a civil war as anarcho-syndicalist riots swept across most parts of the country. Germany, however, secretly provided the syndicalists with arms and money to further destabilize France. The strategy, similar to what Germany used in Russia, was all but successful in the long term, which eventually unleashed a syndical menace in the near future.\n\nLooking for a nation-wide negotiation with the Provisional Government on workers' treatment, the leaders of CGT (General Confederation of Labour), the most influential socialist party in France, were rational and tried to prevent the radical Jacobins, who appealed a violent revolution led by Bolsheviks, from launching attacks. The establishments lost all their patience when mild leftists failed to stop the escalation of crisis, which ultimately led to the French Civil War."

 naval_lore_desc_2_nfa: "As conditions grew untenable for the French government and the military high command, they eventually retreated from the mainland, choosing exile instead of surrender, hoping that this temporary situation would soon be resolved as the newly created Federation of Communes of France would undoubtedly either quickly collapse on itself, or be put down by the German Empire. Neither happened, and the Commune was recognized as the legitimate successor to the Republic by Germany and members of Mitteleuropa.\n\nThe government-in-exile arrived at North Africa in June 1920 escorted by loyal members of the Mediterranean Fleet, waiting to take back the mainland one day. However, the African colonies lacked basic industries and manpower to build an army. In the early 1920s, the main forces of National Navy were two Courbets, two Bretagnes, and a couple of pre-dreadnoughts. It could rely on dockyards in Ferryville and Dakar to maintain some of light ships, but the rest were rapidly aging.\n\nFacing more and more tense confrontations off the coast of Corsica, the National Navy was forced to place orders for ships to prepare for a possible invasion of mainland. It seized the opportunity when the political and diplomatic air began to change in Europe.\n\nWith the British Isles fractured in revolution, old powers in Europe were keeping a watchful eye and lifted restrictions of arms exports. Among them, Two Sicilies was known for its busy shipyards and willingness to export warships to former Entente members. The first ships ordered by exiles were six 17,500-ton Pothau-class cruisers, with only Pothau herself finished due to exiles' poor financial condition. Laid down in Naples, 1924, it was armed with two triple 330mm turrets forward of the bridge, and was completed in 1927.\n\nOut of strategic reason, the Austro-Hungarian Empire also gave greenlight to one of its largest naval contractors, STT (Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino), to export a couple of battleships in exchange for French capital assets in Italy and Balkan. Laid in 1933, the resulting battleships, Union Sacrée and France, were armed with nine 380mm guns, referencing Austrian design of Hunyadi-class to a large extent. To purchase them, the Republic has almost exhausted all its foreign exchange reserve.\n\nDespite all this, the exiles were too vulnerable to take on the syndicalists alone. After the collapse of British Empire, the remnants of the Entente Cordiale were marginalized globally, and it seemed that the return to motherland would never come. However, with intensifying situation in Europe, the exiles will bide their time. When the final struggle arrives, the National Navy will become the spearhead of the Republic."

 naval_lore_desc_2_fra: "During the civil war, the French navy was divided as was the rest of the nation. There were some engagements between nationalist and syndicalist naval units, but most of the ships remained in their ports as fuel was scarce and crews divided. When the war was over, ships stayed in mainland France became backbone of the newborn French People's Liberation Navy, or Marine de libération du Peuple.\n\nCommunal navy has two main fleets based in Brest and Toulon, and is relatively undeveloped. Its major mission is patrolling territorial waters and preventing landings into French coasts, instead of projecting influence abroad. Except for insurgent ships, the Communal Navy also tried to finish the Normandie-class in the 1920s. However, the naval race had rendered its design powerless against German ships. In the end, limited budgets led to that only two of them were finished, one as battleship, and the other as aircraft carrier Eugène Pottier.\n\nThe old doctrine gradually changed after the establishment of Union of Britain, and the Commune transformed its navy into an offensive force, targeting German Empire in its weakest point - supply lines from colonies powering its war machine. Centered around logistic raiding, France developed a few types of light ships. In 1927, France, togethter with Socialist Italy, launched the modern cruiser programs, and proposed two types of raider cruisers, the Rennes-class and better armored Lyon-class. They were grouped with squadrons of large destroyers, such as the Communard-class, to ambush convoys on the Atlantic. Witnessing successful German submarine warfare in the 1910s, France also emphasized on developing its submarine fleet which was represented by one of the deadliest, the Émeraude-class.\n\nCorresponding to British fleet renewal programs, French also started theirs in the 1930s, though the programs were quite limited in scale compared to British allies. The naval strategy of the Third Internationale in most repeated that of Anglo-French Alliance during the Weltkrieg, which made Austrian and German squadrons in the Mediterranean major enemies of French navy. In an effort to update its aging capital ships, the Commune ordered two Internationale-class in 1932 and assigned them to the Mediterranean Fleet. They were later reinforced by Le Fantasque- and Verdun-class destroyers in 1935. On the other hand, four Charles Fourier-class large cruisers were laid in late-1933. They would join the Atlantic Fleet for hunting down isolated scout ships and convoys.\n\nFor a long time, navy has been a small branch of Communal military forces, but it has been improving. Bearing hopes from proletariat of the world, the red Gallic Rooster will rise and shine."

 naval_lore_desc_1_rus: "Formally established in 1696, the Imperial Russian Navy lasted until dissolved in the wake of the February Revolution of 1917. It developed from a smaller force that had existed prior to Tsar Peter the Great's founding of the modern Russian navy during the Second Azov campaign in 1696. It expanded in late 18th century and reached its peak strength by the early part of the 19th century, behind only the British and French fleets in terms of size.\n\nHowever, Russia's slow technical and economic development in the 19th century caused her to fall behind other European countries in the field of steamboat. The glory of her navy was crushed and humiliated after swallowing a bitter defeat in the Tsushima Strait during the Russo-Japanese War, making Russia the only European country that lost to Asian in a full-out war. At the end of the war, Russia fell from the third greatest naval power to sixth place. The focus of the Russian navy then shifted from the Far East to the Baltic, defending Petersburg from the German Empire.\n\nIn 1907, a naval expansion program was put before the Duma but voted down, yet the later Bosnian Crisis forced reconsideration. Facing an inevitable German-Austrian alliance, Russia felt threatened by Austria's bolder actions targeting Serbia, a close ally of Russia. Four Gangut-class battleships were laid down in 1909 to phase out the pre-dreadnoughts in the navy and guard the Gulf of Finland. Delivered before the war, the turrets and fire controls of Ganguts were barely finished in mid-1915. Meanwhile, three similarly designed Imperatritsa Mariya-class were built for the Black Sea Fleet in response to the worsening relationship with Ottoman. The rearmament program included a significant element of foreign participation with several ships (including the cruiser Rurik) and machinery ordered from foreign firms. After the outbreak of Weltkrieg, ships and equipment being built in Germany were confiscated, and those from the United Kingdom was slow in reaching Russia or was diverted to the Western Allies' own war effort.\n\nIn the course of the war, Russian navy engaged Germany and Ottoman on two fronts. With the German fleet larger and more modernized in the Baltic, the Russian navy played a defensive role, at most attacking German convoys and laying mines. However, with a larger fleet based in Sevastopol, the Black Sea has become Russia's domain, and it was led by two skilled commanders: Admiral Eberhart and Admiral Kolchak. Their arts of commanding brought the Turkish with heavy losses, securing sea supremacy for Russia in this area. The greatest loss suffered by the Black Sea fleet was the destruction of the battleship Imperatritsa Mariya, which blew up in port on 7 October 1916.\n\nEven though Russia in 1916 still had the strength to launch decisive campaigns like the Brusilov Offensive, it had already reached the breaking point when the famine and countless coffins from the frontline frustrated every Russian. With people losing faith in the Tsar's regime, there were large-scale protests in the capital region, forcing the Tsar to abdicate. This is known as the February Revolution."

 naval_lore_desc_2_rus: "Without a centralized power structure, the provisional government became unpopular immediately after it decided to continue the war on the Entente side. Although Russia's military forces were already crumbling, it still possessed a formidable size. Germany, as a result, found that putting an end to the eastern front was necessary. It launched massive offensives in Eastern Europe and the Gulf of Riga in 1917, trying to force Russia out of the war.\n\nThe high hopes felt across Russia following the February Revolution had diminished to almost nothing by the closing weeks of 1917. The Provisional Government's ineffectual policies and weak authority in the face of the Petrograd Soviet had left the capital paralyzed with incessant street fighting and political turmoil. An attempted \"March on Petrograd\" by General Lavr Kornilov in August demonstrated the army's willingness to restore order, but President Alexander Kerensky has instead made the disastrous mistake of freeing the Bolsheviks to protect the city.\n\nDespite the conspiracy that Germany was behind the return of Vladimir Lenin, communism became quite popular among workers and soldiers. The antagonism felt betweem soldiers and their officers, workers and authorities, has finally led to the October Revolution and the brutal Russian Civil War.\n\nMost sailors sided with the Bolsheviks, but their ships remained in port due to shortage of fuel. With the communists controlling key industrial regions, the anti-Bolsheviks factions also put up their fights to unite Russia. Typically referred as the White Army, they were never united as a whole and were weak compared to the Red Army. However, after the assassination of Lenin, Germany started to send aid and personnel to the Whites fearing the exportation of Bolshevik revolution, which granted the Whites an edge over the Reds. In 1920, the victorious White Army signed the Treaty of Minsk with Germany to re-ratify the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk right after the siege of Moscow, ending the 3-year civil war.\n\nThe Eastern European states of the former Russian Empire achieved their independence, and were absorbed into Germany's military alliance, the Reichspakt. With Sevastopol lost to Germany, the newly born Ukrainian state inherited quite a few combat ships of the former Black Sea Fleet, including Imperatritsa Mariya- and Evstafi-class battleships, while a few destroyers were returned to Russian Republic as a symbol of friendship.\n\nRussian navy has experienced a period of shrink throughout the 1920s. Most of its outdated ships scrapped or sold, but it still commissioned some ships against all odds, such as the Svetlana-class built by Imperial Russia, which have been 90% completed by 1917 and suspended since then. In late-1920s, strategists of the Russian navy, led by Admiral Alexander Kolchak, agreed concentration on developing an asymmetric naval force in the Baltic. Due to financial problems, Kolchak's plan progressed slowly in the 1930s, and only witnessed completion of a few cruisers and destroyers for Baltic and Black Sea Fleet.\n\nIn 1936, despite a strong presence in the Baltic and the Black Sea, the Russian Navy had few ships in the Barents and Pacific region. It would still take years before the Russian Navy gets back to its original place."

 naval_lore_desc_1_aus: "The Kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine, or in short k.u.k. Kriegsmarine, is one of the three branches of Habsburg military forces, and was not formally established until the 18th century. It had a long history of rivalry with Italian navy and took part in many battles in the War of Italian Independence.\n\nAs the dreadnought race raging between Britain and Germany, Austria and Italy were in a race of their own for domination of the Adriatic Sea. Upon the completion of HMS Dreadnought, Austria's naval architects, aware of the inevitable dominance of dreadnought battleships, presented their case of Tegetthoff-class to the War Ministry, in an attempt to match Italy's fleet. Although not everyone is interested in the naval expansion, it met a strong supporter in royalty, Archduke Ferdinand.\n\nHowever, the fragile peace in Europe was ended by a shot ringing across Sarajevo and Archduke Ferdinand lying in his blood. When his body was carried back to Austria aboard SMS Viribus Unitis, it prompted the empire to mobilize and send a strongly-worded ultimatum to Serbia, whose intelligence agency was believed to be behind the assassination. The tensions drew concerns from other powers and initiated a month of diplomatic manoeuvring, known as the July Crisis. Russia's warning was ignored by Austria, and it began shelling Belgrade on 28 July 1914, which marked the start of Weltkrieg.\n\nAustrian navy saw some action during the war, but prior to Italian entry spent much of its time in its major base at Pola, except for small skirmishes. While the surface fleet at most supported offensives on land with shore bombardments, the U-boat campaign on the Mediterranean Sea was such a success that it forced the Entente to block the Otranto Strait. In 1917, Capitan Miklós Horthy led an assualt on the barrage which ended surprisingly in Austria's favour, but his second attempt in June 1918 was doomed when the fleet was accidentally spotted by an Italian MAS boat, culminating in the sinking of SMS Szent István.\n\nIn the final days of the war, the Italian government tried to facilitate a peace deal with Austria by offering land and assets of war, including part of its navy. However, this decision went public and was immediately under attack from angry people, who would never tolerate such disgrace combined with thousands of lives lost in the war. As standoffs raging across its society, Italy fell into a state of anarchy before any official agreements could be reached with the Central Powers. To eliminate naval threats from Italy once and for all, Austria schemed a frogman attack on its naval bases, crippling two dreadnoughts, Conte di Cavour and Giulio Cesare. They were evaluated as unrepairable and waived by Italian authority after the civil war.\n\nDespite standing amongst victors of the Weltkrieg, the war revealed divisions of culture, class, and ideology within the Empire ever so clearly. Austria struggled in the first few years to put down inner unrests and restore orders in its military occupied zones of Northern Italy and Ukraine. The naval modernization was hampered due to these distractions, with only one Admiral Njegovan-class cruiser, an improved version of Helgoland, laid in 1919.\n\nTrailing far behind other naval powers, the Austro-Hungarian Empire almost stagnated in terms of navy, making it an insignificant player in the midst of the Second Naval Arms Race."

 naval_lore_desc_2_aus: "As tensions cooled down a little bit in the early 1920s, Kaiser Karl, following in the footsteps of the assassinated Franz Ferdinand, began trying to reform the multinational Austro-Hungarian Empire into something that could survive in the twentieth century, launched a series of large-scale reforms. The federalization met resistance from the nobility of Hungary, and was also affected by autonomy movements in Cisleithanian region, leading to little progress of the Kaiser's plan.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine, in the face of severe financial state, stayed away from the heating naval race. It instead focused on screen ships and submarines with strategic consideration that large ships proved to be inefficient in narrow waters along Austrian and Croatian coast. As products of the Ersatz Huszár project and part of the post-war rearmament program, eight Dragoner-class destroyers were ordered in 1922.\n\nIn spite of internal debates about building expensive heavy ships, the navy still found it necessary to upgrade its fleet of merely three old dreadnoughts. Early in 1914, the government had approved to build four battleships for 1915-1918 naval program at the request of Anton Haus, Commander-in-Chief of the navy. Designed as the Ersatz Monarch, the constrcution of the four battleships, later Hunyadi-class, was suspended during the war. Although they were so close to be scrapped, Haus objected to a cancellation and in February 1915 a compromise was reached where construction would resume after the war. Finished in 1925, they were originally armed with ten 350mm guns and refitted with eight 380mm guns in 1930.\n\nHowever, Austria's naval development was brought down after the Hungarian parliament refused to finance their share of naval budget, forcing the navy to look for cheaper designs. The resulting Schwarzenberg-class was largely based on Hunyadi, weaker but faster, fitting ten 350mm guns in four turrets. Two of them were completed in 1933, while the funding of another two just started in late-1934.\n\nWith growing Communal naval strength in the Mediterranean, Austria felt threatened that it might face another blockade by French in an upcoming war. Four Meteor-class destroyers and a pair of Custozza-class cruisers were ordered in the 1930s to counter it. Meanwhile, a squadron of submarines were built with German technologies. Quiter than any Austrian submarines before, the U-120 class was made to operate in shallow waters.\n\nAs tensions mounting in Europe, Austria was vigilant to a nearing German-Franco conflict, while its old enemies were also making strength for the revenge. Although the Kriegsmarine was often neglected, it still remained as an important part of national defense for the Austro-Hungarian Empire in these uncertain times."
