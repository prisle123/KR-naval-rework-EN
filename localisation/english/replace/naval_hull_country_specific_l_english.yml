 JAP_ship_hull_heavy_1_desc: "As the traditional martime power in East Asia, Japan introduced numerous shipbuilding technologies from Britain before 1910, such as 14-inch cannons, and even many of its ships were built by the United Kingdom. Japan constructed Fuso-class battleships and Kongo-class battlecruisers during Weltkrieg, ushering in the era of eight-eight fleet. The early dreadnoughts of Japan had some British ancestry, but Japan gradually found its own path with the Nagato-class in service around 1920 that raised its caliber to 410mm. Tosa-class was built next as a response to German Preußen-class, which became the symbol of Japan manufacturing for its excellent performance. Four Amagi-class battlecruisers were ordered at the same time, laid a solid foundation for the subsequent Kii-class."
 JAP_ship_hull_heavy_2_desc: "In 1925, the Great Depression started from the United States had a great impact on Japan's economy when it sank 70% of Taisho 12th annual budget into the navy, which only made the government's finicial pressure steeper. Fearing the envy from army, government had to cut 80% of naval funding, leading to many warship projects cancelled including the mighty Aki-class super dreadnoughts equipped with twelve 460mm guns. Though navy admitted the Dreadnought Race is lost, it still tried to save the Kii-class under the lobbying of former PM Yamamoto Gonbee, and the construction lasted until late 1920s due to short of funding. As economy slowly recovering in the 1930s, Japan is ready to strengthen its battleship forces."
 JAP_ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff_desc: "Immediately after the navy's expenditure got cut, the refit of aging Kongo-class was stagnant. However, these old ships built before the Weltkrieg were unable to cope with the evolution of warfare. In 1927, two Furutaka-class cruiser, improved from the original B65 project, were ordered, reusing the technology of Kongo-class and equipping six 356mm guns. A few months later, two tuned Aoba-class were added. In western naval archives, the two classes were often grouped into one, with German calling them revived armored cruisers, and the United States annd Britain positioning them as pocket battlecruisers."
 JAP_early_ship_hull_carrier_desc: "As early as during the Battle of Tsingtao, the navy had realized the possibility of aircraft, though they were just simple seaplanes at that time. Japan obtained a large amount of carrier related intel through the military attachés stationed in Britain. In 1918, Japan became one of the first countries to build carriers. Even though Hosho could only carry 15 planes, it also stated that Japan was already the pioneer of naval aviation. It took five years before navy got rid of reducing budget and commissioned Ryujo in 1927 ship replenishment plan, and converted submarine tender Taigei to carrier Ryuen in 1933."
 JAP_ship_hull_carrier_1_desc: "The Second Maru Keikau started in 1934 when British Republican Navy topped research on aircraft carrier. Japan, through intelligence personnel in Britain and large scale of experiments thought aircraft has the potential to bring down a battleship. Thus, it is necessary for Japan to build its own fleet carrier. Not concentrating on deck protection as Union of Britain did, Japan needed to fight Germany or the United States in waters far from homeland in the first place, so its carrier's capacity and self-sustainability were particularly important. Soryu was born in this context, and from this point, aviation tactics gradually became mainstream in the navy."
 JAP_ship_hull_super_heavy_1_desc: "When Japan was steadily developing the eight-eight fleet, the Dreadnought Race between Britain and Germany broke out fused by five newly built Preußen-class. In just two years, the British Magnificent-class, German Schleisien-class and American South Carolina-class battleships increased their gun caliber to 18 inches, posing a huge threat to Japanese navy. According to original plan, Japan would build No.13 battlecruiser with eight 460mm guns after Kii-class commissioned. In order to suppress the European counterparts, the navy began building of two Aki-class battleships equipped with twelve 460mm guns in four turrets when there were many technical deficiencies. However, they were all scrapped after 1925 at 15% completed."
 JAP_ship_hull_cruiser_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg heralded the dawn of new cruisers, In 1915, influenced by British Arethusa-class and C-class, Japan began to explore using small cruisers. The 4,000-ton Tenryu-class cruiser proved to be incapable of being destroyer flagship, and its hull enlarged from destroyer also not suitable for long-range sailing. This issue was not solved until the Kuma-class launched two years later, which set the standard of 5,500 tons of displacement for Japanese light cruisers. After 1920, except for the experimental Yubari-class, the Nagara-class and Sendai-class were built to reinforce expanding fleet. Japanese cruisers are known for their powerful torpedoes, which allow them to consume enemy under the guidance of decisive battle strategy."
 JAP_ship_hull_cruiser_2_desc: "By the end of 1920s, the United States took the lead in building a number of large cruisers. For a long time after armored cruisers outdated, the naval powers had invested in escort cruisers to protect expanding capital ship forces. Large cruisers broke this balance with 8-inch guns and cheap cost. Japan soon joined the cruiser race with the most representative Tokachi-class and Monobe-class cruisers, both classes are equipped with ten 203mm guns. Although there are some gaps compared to German and American, they still became the main cruisers of Japan for low-cost and versatility.\nAt the same time, facing the enlargement of cruisers, the newly designed Agano-class has increased its displacement to 6,500 tons with better anti-air and manoeuvrability"
 JAP_ship_hull_light_1_desc: "Japan added a considerable amount of destroyers in eight-four fleet plan after the war. The Minekaze-class, Kamikaze-class and Mutsuki-class destroyers all sails at around 37kn to escort the Amagi-class battlecruisers. As more resources diverted to big ships, the navy built some second-class destroyers, such as Momo and Momi-class, to relieve first-class destroyers on coastal defenses. The demand for new destroyers was put on the agenda as eight-eight fleet upgrading, and technical department had strict requirements for subsequent plans to greatly improve combat capability of destroyers. The Special-Type destroyer was equipped with six 127mm guns and six torpedo tubes, limiting the displacement to 1,700 tons. Fubuki and Akatsuki-class were among the best built by Japan, but they were still unstable due to the heavy armaments."
 JAP_ship_hull_light_2_desc: "Shocked by Tomozuru Incident, the navy made changes to ship designing based on Special-Type destroyers. In addition to structurally enhancing Hatsuharu-class destroyers in the construction process, the design of subsequent ships was also reviewed. The Shiratsuyu-class focused on solving fatal problem of center of gravity, but the 1,500-ton platform was simply difficult to meet navy's requirements. The displacement was raised to 2,300 tons on the following Asashio-class. Despite many problems, the Hatsuharu and Shiratsuyu-class were the first Japanese ships able to launch Type 93 oxygen torpedoes, which are considered the nemesis of American battleships."
 
 GER_ship_hull_heavy_1_desc: "Germany was one of the first countries to follow after the advent of dreadnought. Kaiser and König-class were built right after Nassau and Helgoland-class to deal with British Iron Duke-class, advanced but still behind its rivals. German failure to restart unlimited submarine warfare led to plenty of invests in surface fleet. Completing Bayern-class battleships and Mackensen-class battlecruisers didn't halt German effort to build more, it started construction of five Preußen-class and seven Siegfried-class battleships in the 1920s based on L-20e project. These ships, equipped with eight 420mm guns and 350mm main armor belt, were considered the fuse of Dreadnought Race. In addition to battleships, three Yorck-class battlecruisers were built in 1919 and received two new orders two years later."
 GER_ship_hull_heavy_2_desc: "The Dreadnought Race has witnessed the madness of naval powers. At the end of 1920s, the first line super dreadnoughts were all equipped with 18-inch main guns and heavy armor. But after the shipbuilding frenzy subsided, most of the sensible officers of the German Naval Command admitted the more practical high-speed battleships are what Germany needs. In 1933, four Blücher-class battleships, which were improved on the basis of Yorck-class, began construction. Compared with its predecessors, Blücher-class once again used 420mm guns, and improved its bridge structure and armor. Except for the third and fourth ships, which were converted into cariers, the other two became the main force of the recon fleet."
 GER_ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff_desc: "In the late 1920s, after learning that the United States and Japan were building large-scale cruisers, German naval designers took a different approach by improving the old design of armored cruiser. Armored cruisers are cheaper but poorly equipped compared to battleships, it later evolved into battlecruiser which is faster and more powerful. The revived armored cruiser, however, combines some merits of both cruiser and battlecruiser. Its main guns are also quite advantageous to ordinary cruiser's, allowing it to undertake tasks of cruisers and capital ships. In 1927, construction of five Prinz Heinrich-class with six 280mm guns began, most of which would be assigned to East Asia Fleet. They were followed by three Prinz Adalbert-class in just five years, replacing old battlecruisers such as SMS Von der Tann."
 GER_early_ship_hull_carrier_desc: "During the Weltkrieg, Germany had preliminarily explored naval aviation on cruisers including SMS Stuttgart and SMS Roon. In 1918, the carrier conversion project led by the aviation department converted three freighters into the Main-class carrier which could only carry less than 20 seaplanes. It was not until aircraft replaced the Zeppelins that German navy finally recognized the value of carrier, but only as a recon ship. The Weser-class built in the Naval Act of 1932 was a direct demonstration of such theory. The German carriers are flexible with armor to defend cruisers, trading off their capacity. In order to chanllenge carriers of the Union of Britain, Germany converted two Blücher-class battleships into Roon-class carriers in 1934, but still difficult to fill the gap in naval aviation."
 GER_ship_hull_carrier_1_desc: "To fill the vacany of the Zeppelins, German navy built a group of light aircraft carriers to provide aerial reconnaissance for the fleet. In 1932, the Reichstag approved two Weser-class carriers, a specially designed type of carriers with a top speed of 35kn, enough to accompany battlecruisers in action. The Weser-class was able to carry 20 aircrafts, which was far behind the carriers of other naval powers. Still, feeling threatened, the Union of Britain built two Republic-class carriers in response just a few months later."
 GER_ship_hull_super_heavy_1_desc: "In 1921, the British Magnificent-class first pushed the record for main gun caliber to 18 inches, and the Imperial Naval Office immediately started designing the L27 programme. Two years later, it came to fruition as Schleisien-class battleships. The ships were equipped with nine 480mm guns, among five planned, only two were actually finished, becoming the largest battleships ever built in the history of German navy. However, they were soon surpassed by the successor, the 80,000-ton Kaiser Wilhelm-class with eight 508mm guns, in 1925. It took Krupp half a year widening the shipyard to accomandate its huge hull. Launched in 1928 to celebrate the Ruby Jubilee of Kaiser, it was not until 1932 that the huge ship was finally finished, but suffered many mechanical malfunctions from its complex structure."
 GER_ship_hull_cruiser_1_desc: "At the end of the 1890s, German navy took 5,500-ton displacement as boundary, and classified any cruiser smaller than this number as small cruisers. Represented by Kolberg and Köln-class, small cruisers can serve as recon ship in battle fleets, or lead ship of destroyers. Beginning with the Magdeburg class in 1911, small cruisers were equipped with a 60 mm thick waterline armor belt made of nickel steel. In terms of firepower, before the entry of the Pillau-class in 1914, German small cruisers were usually equipped with 105mm main guns, and then 150mm as the standard. With the increasing size of cruisers after the Weltkrieg, most light cruisers can reach a displacement of about 7,000 tons, far exceeding the previous small cruisers."
 GER_ship_hull_cruiser_2_desc: "The interwar period witnessed a lot of giant warships, which pushed cruisers to a larger scale. Germany also followed this trend and show mission-oriented differentiation in cruiser designing. In the mid-to-late 1920s, a dozen of Aachen-class cruisers were commisioned to secure vast colonies, equipping standard triple-mounted 150mm guns and 500mm torpedo tubes. In addition, four Osnabrück-class cruisers were used against British and American counterparts, with 240mm guns improved from old barrel, reinforcing light cruisers or destroyers. The main problems faced by German cruisers were the shortcomings in power system reliability and air defense capabilities, which were likely to be their fatal flaws when entering the war."
 GER_ship_hull_light_1_desc: "Before the Weltkrieg, German positioning of destroyers was only limited to torpedo strikes and smoke screening, with usually small tonnage, and were called torpedo destroyers officially. Ships such as V1, G7 and V25-class all had a displacement below 800 tons and couldn't fight in open waters. In 1914, B97-class increased its displacement to 1,300 tons, achieving unexpected but gratifying results, which encouraged German to build larger destroyers.\nOn the S113-class destroyer built in 1916, this number soared to 2,000 tons, supporting more powerful weapons. Although the V170 class built at the end of the war was made smaller to rapidly expand the destroyer fleet, Germany still did not give up its efforts to enlarge the destroyer after that."
 GER_ship_hull_light_2_desc: "With the optimization of destroyers after Weltkrieg, Germany designed an extremely successful hull platform, Type 1924 destroyer, in the 1920s. Some archives would name it after the leading ship of T214. Later, Germany launched improved types in 1926, 1928 and 1934 respectively, making some modifications to the power and armament, and there were also subtypes designed for various tasks and areas. By 1936, more than a hundred T214-class were built to replace most of the old destroyers in service during the Weltkrieg. Compared with British and American, German destroyers were larger, and they paid more attention to traditional weapons such as cannons and torpedoes."
 
 ENG_ship_hull_heavy_1_desc: "HMS Dreadnought entering service in 1906 marked a new era of dreadnoughts. Britain built battleships such as Iron Duke-class throughout the 1910s, and their performance has long suppressed others. In the pre-Weltkrieg design of Queen Elizabeth-class, Britain first proposed the concept of fast battleships. Seven more economical Revenge-class were soon ordered, with five finished and two refitted as Renown-class battlecruisers. Witnessing heavy losses of battlecruisers in the battle of Jutland, Admiral class were developed, with further improved armor scheme and 15-inch guns, becoming the best battlecruisers in the world.\nIn 1919, as dust settled, British investment in the navy had gradually cooled, until Germany's aggressive shipbuilding programme a few months later forced it to restart."
 ENG_ship_hull_heavy_2_desc: "Beginning in 1920, Britain had engaged in the Dreadnought Race with orders of Magnificent-class and Nelson-class, which were based on N3 and G3 projects. By 1924, when Austin Chamberlain's administration stopped its overfunding in navy, most of the ships were not finished. To relieve the unemployed shipbuilders, the Naval Construction Commitee of the Union of Britain continued those unfinished. In the 1930s, as refit of Renown and Nelson-class mostly completed, Britain tried to spare resources for its battleships. Four Union-class were ordered against German dreadnoughts, and two finished just by 1936, while most junior naval officers were willing to spend money on promising carriers.\nAs carrier forces taking shape in the following two years, four Bondfield-class, designed to escape the influence of conservatives, were built to reinforce the carriers."
 ENG_ship_hull_super_heavy_1_desc: "The Magnificent-class built in 1921 was the first ship to equip 18-inch guns. Influenced by it, German constructed Schleisien and Kaiser Wilhelm-class, and American, the South Carolina-class. As 1925 Revolution looming, the first three ships were evacuated to Canada along with other interwar warships, while the fourth was destroyed, which made the battleships of the Union of Britain vulnerable. In the 1930s, Republican Navy spared some funds to build the Union-class battleships tuned from M2 project. This class has four turrets and twelve 18-inch guns, and was one of the largest ships ever built, considered as the serious competitor of Kaiser Wilhelm-class by many."
 ENG_early_ship_hull_carrier_desc: "Britain was one of the first countries to develop aircraft carriers. Commissioned in 1918, HMS Argus promoted the full-length flight deck to be the future of all carriers that followed, overwhelming refit seaplane cruisers during Weltkrieg. However, the outbreak of British Revolution interrupted the development of British carriers as Argus and Hermes evacuated to Canada. Driven by naval aviation supporters in the Repbulican Navy, the Courageous-class cruisers were converted into carriers in 1927, removing all of their armaments and superstructures. With the double-deck hangar, Courageous-class could carry 50 to 60 aircrafts, but they were later surpassed in the 1930s. Aiming to expand its carrier forces, Repbulican Navy converted the second battleship of Union-class, RNS Equality, into the largest carrier in human history, later known as RNS Rebecca. If its deck space was used effectively, Rebecca could carry more than 80 planes, which forced Germany to refit Roon and Blumenthal as a response."
 ENG_ship_hull_carrier_1_desc: "Through experience learned in the conversion of Courageous-class, the Republican Navy realized the value of carrier when its battleships were still weak against German. In 1932, two Weser-class were added to German Naval Act, reinforcing its recon fleet, and that pushed the Union to react with two Republic-class laid down in 1933. The Republic-class had a smaller hangar than Courageous, carrying 40 aircrafts. Among all technologies it adopted, the most representative was the armored flight deck. Widely used on British carrier, the idea of trading capacity for armor was quite different from the United States and Japan but it ensured carriers to operate even after bombed, which is vital in areas like North Sea where ships are often vulnerable to air strikes. In terms of the capacity, the British developed a series of brilliant methods to arrange deck space, and increased it by 10."
